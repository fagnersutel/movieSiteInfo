He was sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947. Dufresne was the frequent target of sexual abuse from a prison clique known as the Sisters. His sage financial advice earned him protection from prison guards. Dufresne used his considerable intelligence and education to improve the prison library, which he named after former inmate and librarian Brooks Hatlen, and helped a number of convicts earn their high school diplomas. He also used his banking knowledge to start a money laundering scheme on behalf of prison warden Samuel Norton. In 1966 Dufresne attempted to win a new trial when fellow inmate Tommy Williams told the story of a former cellmate at another prison confessing to the murder of Dufresne's wife and lover. Warden Norton squashed Dufresne's hopes out of fear that Andy would inform authorities of the money laundering despite Andy's promise to remain silent. After spending two months in an area of the prison known as \"the hole\", during which time Williams was assassinated, Dufresne escaped from Shawshank. He took documental evidence of the laundering scheme with him, which he would later mail to a Portland newspaper. Using the alias Randall Stevens (the name under the illegal accounts) Dufresne visited a number of Portland-area banks, withdrawing approximately $370,000, money Norton intended to retire with. Dufresne buried some money in a hayfield near Buxton, Maine, at a location only known to his prison friend Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, then fled to Zihuatanejo, Mexico, where he operated a hotel with charter fishing services for guests. Dufresne was later joined by Redding after Red was paroled and discovered the money Andy left for him in the Buxton hayfield.","Convicted murderer Ellis Boyd Redding was sent to Shawshank Prison in Maine in 1927. He was given the nickname \"Red\" for his Irish heritage and as a play on his last name. Redding had a reputation for smuggling items into prison such as playing cards, whiskey, marijuana, and posters. Redding was denied parole in 1947 and 1957 despite pleas to the parole board that he had been rehabilitated. Redding was granted parole in 1967 even though he displayed callous indifference to the parole board; afterwards he lived in a halfway house and worked as a bagger at a grocery store. In keeping a promise to his friend, escaped inmate Andy Dufresne, Redding traveled to a hayfield near Buxton, Maine to unearth an item buried near an oak tree and rock wall. The item was a box containing money and an invitation to join Dufresne at his location undisclosed in the letter; Redding knew the site as Zihuatanejo, Mexico from an earlier conversation he had with Dufresne in the prison yard. Redding used the money for bus fare to Fort Hancock, Texas, en route to Zihuatanejo.","The Warden of Shawshank who relies on one thing, being a hardnut and God.

Castellano","Robert Duvall","Sterling Hayden","John Marley","Richard Conte","Diane Keaton","Abe Vigoda"],"Bio":["BiographyIn the first film, Don Vito Corleone was portrayed by Marlon Brando. Though composed of characteristics of many gangsters, the Vito Corleone character is based largely on those of Frank Costello and Carlo Gambino. Like Costello, Vito has a raspy voice, has politicians and judges on his payroll, and has many gambling interests. Like Gambino, Vito is very cunning.In Puzo's novel, Vito is the head of the Corleone crime family, the most powerful Mafia family in the New York City area if not the country. He is depicted as an ambitious Italian immigrant who moves to Hell's Kitchen and builds a Mafia empire, yet retains (and strictly adheres to) his own personal code of honor. His youngest son, Michael Corleone, becomes the Don upon his death at the end of the novel. He has two other sons, Santino \"Sonny\" Corleone and Fredo Corleone, and a daughter, Connie Corleone, all of whom play major roles in the story. He also informally adopted another son, Tom Hagen, who grew up to become the Family's consigliere.Early lifeIn the chronology of the Godfather saga, Vito first appears in 1901 as a young boy in the small Sicilian town of Corleone. As documented in the novel (and in Godfather Part II), his father, Antonio Andolini, is murdered by the local Mafia boss, Don Ciccio, because he refused to pay tribute to him. His older brother, Paolo, swears revenge, but is himself murdered soon after. Eventually, Ciccio's henchmen come to the residence of the Andolinis to take Vito away and have him killed. Desperate, Signora Andolini takes her son to see the mafia chieftain herselfImmigration to AmericaWhen Vito's mother goes to see Don Ciccio, she begs him to spare Vito. However, Ciccio refuses, reasoning that Vito would also seek revenge as an adult. Upon Ciccio's refusal, Signora Andolini puts a knife to his throat, allowing her son to escape, but is then murdered by Ciccio's guards. (In the novel, she survives being shot and later reunites with her son in Sicily many years later.) Later that night, he is smuggled away, fleeing Sicily to seek refuge in America on a cargo ship full of immigrants. In the novel, he deliberately changes his name to Corleone, after his home town. The movie, however, plays that he is renamed \"Vito Corleone\" because the immigration workers at Ellis Island mistake \"Andolini\" for his middle name and the name of his town for his last name. According to The Godfather: Part II, he later adopted the middle name \"Andolini\" to acknowledge his heritage, though this could have been done posthumously by his family.Adopted by the Abbandando familyCorleone is later adopted by the Abbandando family in New York City's Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, and he befriends their son, Genco, who becomes like a brother to him. Corleone begins making an honest living at Abbandando's grocery store on Ninth Avenue, but loses the job, as an intimidated Abbandando is forced to fire Vito to make room for the nephew of Don Fanucci, a blackhander and the local neighborhood padrone.Corleone soon learns to survive and prosper through petty crime and performing favors in return for loyalty. During this time, he also befriends two other low-level hoods, Peter Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio. In 1919, he commits his first murder, killing Fanucci, who had tried to extort money from him. Corleone chooses the day of a major festival to spy on Fanucci from the rooftops as Fanucci goes home, and surprises him at the door to his apartment. He shoots Fanucci three times, as the din from the festival drowns out the noise from the gunshots.Rise as an olive oil importerAs a young man, Corleone starts an olive oil business, Genco Pura (known as simply Genco Olive Oil in the films) with his friend Genco Abbandando. The company eventually becomes the biggest olive oil importer in the nation. Over the years he uses it as a legal front for his organized crime syndicate, while amassing a fortune with his illegal operations. In 1925, he returns to Sicily for the first time since leaving 24 years earlier. He and his partner, Don Tommasino then set up a meeting with the aging Don Ciccio, where he kills him by carving his stomach open, thus avenging his murdered father, mother and brother.Organized CrimeBy the early 1930s, Vito Corleone has organized his illegal operations as the Corleone crime family. Genco Abbandando becomes his consigliere, or advisor, with Clemenza and Tessio as capo regimes. Later, his son Sonny becomes a capo as well, and eventually his under-boss. Around 1939, he moves his base of operations to Long Beach, on Long Island. While he oversees a business founded on gambling, bootlegging, and union corruption, he is known as a kind, generous man who lives by a strict moral code of loyalty to friends and, above all, family. At the same time, he is known as a traditionalist who demands respect commensurate with his status. By the time of the novel and film, even his three closest friends Genco, Pete and Salnever call him \"Vito,\" but either \"Godfather\" or \"Don Corleone.\" In both the book and the first scene of the first Godfather, he chastises his old friend, undertaker Bonasera, for not coming to him first after his daughter is beaten up instead of going to the police. Although he has a reputation for ruthlessness, he disagrees with many of the vicious crimes carried out by gangs and so seeks to control crime in New York by either consuming or eliminating rival gangs. In the mid-1920s, Vito met Hyman Roth (based on real life Jewish mobster Meyer Lansky), who wanted to use Vito's trucks for his own smuggling operation. Vito accepted this offer, and the two became allies for many years.Assassination AttemptIn 1945, Corleone is nearly assassinated when he refuses the request of Virgil Sollozzo to invest in a heroin operation and use his political contacts for the operation's protection. He is supposed to be driven home by his bodyguard, Paulie Gatto (a soldier in the Clemenza regime) along with his son Fredo. When the Don finds that Paulie is not there, Fredo tells him that Paulie has called in sick that day due to a cold. The Don crosses the street to buy oranges and other fruits from a street vendor. At that time, two of Sollozzo's hitmen come out from the shadows with guns drawn. Realizing the situation, the Don tries to sprint back to his Alfa Romeo but he is shot five times in his thighs and arms. Fredo tries to help his father, but fumbles with his gun and can't get to him in time.Certain that the Don is dead, Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen and tells him to get Sonny to accept the drug deal. Hagen agrees, but warns Sollozzo that the Don's fanatically loyal hitman, Luca Brasi, will likely come after Sollozzo. However, Sollozzo doesn't tell Hagen that he helped kill Brasi earlier.Just as Hagen is released, Sollozzo finds out the Don survived. Enraged, he makes a second attempt two days later. The Don is at the French Hospital being guarded by men from Tessio's regime. However, Sollozzo has police Captain Mark McCluskey, who has been on the take for many years, threw Tessio's men in jail, leaving the Don unguarded. Unfortunately for Sollozzo and McCluskey, Michael comes to visit his father just minutes before the attack is due. Realizing that his father is in danger, Michael has a nurse help him move the Don to another room and pretends to stand guard outside the hospital with Enzo the baker.Injuries from the attack put the Don out of action for next three years. Sonny served as acting head of the family during this time. He determined that Paulie Gatto took money from Sollozzo in return for betraying the Don, and ordered him killed. He also got word that the Tattaglias had killed Luca Brasi, and ordered Tessio's men to kill the family's underboss, Bruno Tattaglia. Michael persuaded Sonny to allow him to avenge their father by killing Sollozzo and McCluskey himself.Sonny's death and Vito's returnSonny was himself assassinated, forcing Vito to resume command. He ordered all inquiries made, yet also ordered that no vengeance shall be sought. With the Don incapacitated, the other families had moved in on his business interests, as well as his labor rackets. With the Don's return, rival families now started reconsidering their moves.After Sonny's funeral and other formalities, Vito ordered Hagen to contact Emilio Barzini, the second most powerful Mafia chieftain in the country, in order to arrange a meeting of heads of all the families in America except the Chicago Outfit (considered the \"black sheep\" of the underworld). The meeting took place in the board room of a Manhattan bank whose president was a close friend of the Corleones.In that meeting, Vito renounced all vengeance regarding his son's death. He also said a light yes to the drug operations although he mentioned he never believed in drugs. However, he said he only accepted this for \"selfish reasons\" in order to bring back Michael from exile in Sicily.In this part he said,\"But let me say this. I am a superstitious man, a ridiculous failing but I must confess it here. And so if some unlucky accident should befall my youngest son, if some police officer should accidentally shoot him, if he should hang himself while in his jail cell, if new witnesses appear to testify to his guilt, my superstition will make me feel that it was the result of the ill will still borne me by some people here. Let me go further. If my son is struck by a bolt of lightning I will blame some of the people here. If his plane show fall into the sea or his ship sink beneath the waves of the ocean, if he should catch a mortal fever, if his automobile should be struck by a train, such is my superstition that I would blame the ill will felt by people here.\"RetirementAfter Michael's return from Sicily, Vito installed him in the family business as a learner associate. Michael learned things from his father for more than a year. After Michael's marriage with earlier girlfriend Kay Adams, Vito went into semi-retirement. Michael became operating head of the family, with Vito as an informal consigliere. Michael sent Hagen to Las Vegas to act as the family's lawyer there and lay the groundwork for a planned move of most operations there after Vito's death. Clemenza and Tessio requested permission to break off and form their own families after the move to Las Vegas. Michael's bodyguard Albert 'Al' Neri and Rocco Lampone were chosen to be the future capo regimes of the family. Willi Cicci was also considered, but opted to go with Clemenza's planned family.DeathAt the end of the novel and in the movie, he dies of a heart attack while playing with his grandson Anthony in his garden. His last words in the novel are, \"Life is so beautiful.\" Vito's funeral was a grand affair, with all the other dons, capos and consiglieres in New York attending.Vito told Michael some days before his death that Barzini would set Michael up to be killed under cover of a meeting \"to fix up things.\" Barzini would use a trusted member of the Corleone family as an intermediary. At the funeral, Tessio told Michael that he'd set up a meeting on his territory in Brooklyn, where Michael would presumably be safe. However, Michael had anticipated this and had Tessio killed. Michael then ordered his men to kill Barzini and Tattaglia (in the film, the other two family chiefs as well), thus avenging his father and brother.","Michael is the youngest son of Don Vito Corleone. He is the youngest brother of Sonny and Fredo, and the older brother of Connie.The Godfather: Part IMichael Corleone's ascension to the head of the Corleone crime family is portrayed in Puzo's novel and the first film.Michael initially wants nothing to do with the \"family business\", and is enrolled at Dartmouth College in search of a more Americanized life. After the United States' entry into World War II, he enlists in the Marines against his father's wishes and fights in the Pacific Theatre. For his bravery, Michael is featured in Life magazine in 1944, having been awarded the Navy Cross. Michael is discharged as a Captain to recover from wounds in 1945. He later re-enters Dartmouth, where he meets his future wife, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton).When his father is nearly assassinated in 1945, he volunteers to murder the man responsible, Virgil \"The Turk\" Sollozzo (Al Lettieri). He also proposes to kill Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), a police captain who removed his father's bodyguards from the hospital, presumably to set up his father to be killed. Although it is normally a hard-and-fast rule in the Mafia that law enforcement officials are not to be harmed, Michael successfully convinces his older brother Sonny (James Caan) that since McCluskey is serving as Sollozzo's bodyguard, he has crossed into their world and is fair game.After committing the murders, Michael flees to Sicily under the protection of Don Tommasino, a longtime friend of his father's, and stays in exile for two years. While in Sicily, he marries a young woman named Apollonia (Simonetta Stefanelli), but she is killed by a car bomb intended for Michael. Fabrizio, one of his bodyguards, was paid by a rival family to plant the bomb.While in Sicily, he learns that Sonny had been murdered, and he returns to New York in 1950. There, he reluctantly becomes involved in his family's criminal enterprises, taking over for his deceased brother as operating head of the family under Vito's supervision. The family's consigliere, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and one of the caporegimes, Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano), are somewhat skeptical of his ability, but the other capo, Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda), thinks somewhat more of him. He marries Kay a year later, promising to make the family legitimate within five years.Michael tries to buy a casino from Moe Greene (Alex Rocco) the casino is partly owned \"off the record\" by the Corleone family. He intends to move his family to Nevada. After his father's death in 1955, he becomes official Don of the Corleone crime family. Before his death, Vito had warned Michael that after he was gone, the head of the rival Barzini family would make an attempt on his life under the pretense of organizing a meeting in order to make peace. After Tessio inadvertently reveals that he had conspired with Emilio Barzini (Richard Conte) against him, Michael arranges the murders of Barzini and Philip Tattaglia. In the film, he also kills the other two Mafia chiefs, Carmine Cuneo, and Victor Stracci. Also targeted are Greene, Tessio, Fabrizio and Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), his brother-in-law, who plotted with Barzini to have Sonny killed. With this violent attack, Michael cements his reputation and returns the Corleone family to its position as the most powerful crime family in New York.When his sister Connie (Talia Shire) finds out that Michael had Carlo killed while he stood godfather to their baby, she flies into a rage. Michael dismisses it as hysteria, and when pressed by Kay, denies any involvement in the murder. Just minutes later, however, he meets with his capos, and Clemenza greets him as \"Don Michael.\" In the film, Clemenza greets Michael as \"Don Corleone\" and kisses his hand. Unknown to Michael, Kay is watching this meeting, and realizes that Connie was telling the truth after all and that her husband has become the new Don Corleone.Parallel story: The Sicilian (novel only)\nMichael appears as a secondary character in Puzo's The Sicilian. During his two-year exile in Sicily, Michael is eager to return home to his family in New York, but is told by Clemenza that his father wants him to escort Salvatore \"Turi\" Guiliano safely back to America with him. As he learns more about the reputation and exploits of the legendary Guiliano, Michael becomes extremely intrigued to meet him, but Giuliano dies before the meeting can take place.The Godfather: Part IIBy the time of The Godfather Part II, Michael has moved to shake off his family's Mafia roots. Frank Pentangeli, a longtime associate of his father's, has taken over the family's operations in New York.His efforts at going legitimate prove unsuccessful, however, as his enemies keep him involved in the underworld. He begins to work out a deal with business partner and rival Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) over control of casino operations, but Roth manipulates Michael's brother Fredo (John Cazale) into unwittingly providing him with information used to arrange an attempt on Michael's life.Michael and Roth travel to Cuba to forge a partnership with Fulgencio Batista's regime, allowing them to conduct their operations freely. In the midst of the revolution of 1959, Michael discovers that Fredo has betrayed him.Back home, Kay reveals she has aborted their child because she does not want to bring another son of his into the world. Michael divorces Kay and severs ties with her.Following the death of their mother, Michael orders Fredo's murder, an act he would regret for the rest of his life.The Godfather: Part IIIBy the time of The Godfather Part III (the late 1970s) Michael has taken great steps to making the family legitimate; he is preparing to hand over his interests in gambling to the other Mafia families, setting up a charitable foundation, and is even being recognized by the Vatican for his good works. This new connection to the Church gives Michael the opportunity to purchase a controlling stake in the large property conglomerate, Immobiliare. He also begins to rekindle his relationship with Kay, as well as taking Sonny's illegitimate son, Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), under his wing. He finds himself pulled back into the underworld, however, when almost the entire Mafia Commission is wiped out by an assassin as Michael prepares to hand over his criminal interests. Vinnie responds to this new threat against the Family with brutal violence, publicly gunning down Michael's rival, Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna), who was thought to have ordered the hit on Michael. Vinnie also begins a relationship with Michael's daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola), a romance Michael strongly disapproves of.At the end of the film, weary of the bloody, lonely life of a Don, he retires and makes his nephew the new head of the family, on condition that he end the relationship with Mary. Realizing that powerful interests in Italian politics and business were working to prevent the family's takeover of Immobiliare, Michael, with Vinnie's assistance, once again prepares to move against his enemies. This wave of murders takes place as Michael watches his son Anthony (Franc D'Ambrosio) perform in the opera Cavalleria Rusticana. That same night, however, Mary is inadvertently killed in an assassination attempt on Michael himself. Devastated by this loss, Michael withdraws from life and retires to Sicily, where he dies years later (1997) of a diabetic stroke, sitting alone in a lawn chair.","Born in 1916, Sonny is the most impulsive and violent of Vito's children and, before Michael's rise to power, the most involved in his father's criminal operations. As the oldest child, he serves as a protector to his younger siblings. When Sonny was 16, he committed a robbery. His father learns about it from Peter Clemenza, who stood as godfather to Sonny. When Vito asks Sonny why he did this, Sonny tells him that he saw his father kill Don Fanucci back in 1920. He then tells his father, \"I want to learn how to sell olive oil.\" Vito realizes what Sonny really means, and sends him to Clemenza for training. Sonny \"made his bones\" when he was 19.Sonny eventually becomes a capo in his father's family, gaining a reputation as a ruthless killer. By the end of World War II, he has become his father's underboss and heir apparent. He is not without a softer side, however; at the age of 11, he meets a homeless boy, Tom Hagen, who thereafter lives with the family and becomes the family's consigliere. He also acts as a protector to his younger siblings, especially Connie. The book reveals that he secretly cannot bring himself to harm women or children, or anyone who can't defend themselves, which may be what saves his sister's husband, Carlo Rizzi.Although Sonny has a wife, Sandra, and four children, he frequently cheats on Sandra with other women. At the time of the film, he has carried on a long-running affair with Lucy Mancini, who served as one of his sister's bridesmaids. The normal course of events in Sonnys life is upturned when Virgil 'The Turk' Sollozzo comes to Don Vito with an offer of entering the drug business, backed by the Tattaglia family. Vito rejects the deal, although Sonny shows slight interest. Sollozzo responds by trying to assassinate Vito, in hopes that Sonny will take over the Family and go into the drug business.The assassination attempt fails but leaves Vito near death, although he eventually recovers. Sonny takes over as acting boss and issues an ultimatum to the Tattaglias--turn over Sollozzo or face war. When he learns that Sollozzo instead had his father's top button man, Luca Brasi, killed, he orders Bruno Tattaglia, Don Philip Tattaglia's son, killed in response.Michael, who had previously distanced himself from the family's criminal enterprise, volunteers to kill Sollozzo and his ally, police Captain McCluskey. It is a hard and fast rule in the Mafia that policemen are not to be harmed, but Michael argues that McCluskey is fair game since he is serving as Sollozzo's bodyguard. The normally violent Sonny is initially amused by this, believing Michael is taking McCluskey breaking his jaw the night before too personally. However, convinces him that it's in the family's best interest to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey (\"It's not personal, it's strictly business.\"). Michael kills Sollozzo and McCluskey at Louis's Restaurant in the Bronx and is sent immediately to Sicily to wait out the inevitable crackdown on the Five Families.In retaliation, during the spring of 1948, Tattaglia's partner, Don Emilio Barzini, enlists the help of Sonny's brother-in-law, Carlo Rizzi, in setting a trap for Sonny. Sonny had already given Carlo a savage beating upon learning that Carlo was abusing Connie, unintentionally revealing a weakness. To draw Sonny out into the open, a vengeful Rizzi inflicts a particularly vicious beating on Connie, who telephones Sonny, begging for help. In a fit of rage, Sonny speeds out of the family compound unaccompanied, and heads for Connie's apartment in Hell's Kitchen to confront Rizzi. As Sonny approaches a toll plaza, a number of Barzini's men emerge with Tommy Guns and brutally murder him. As a result, Don Corleone promises not to seek vengeance for his son's death in exchange for stepping down and Michael's safe return home. Later, Michael, who was not part of his father's promise, has all of his opponents assassinated and has Carlo garroted to death in revenge.Role in Godfather sequelsSonny appears in the original Godfather and in its sequel, The Godfather Part II. In the latter film, he briefly appears in a flashback scene portraying the family dinner in which Michael announces he is volunteering to fight in World War II. He is angered by Michael's decision, and he berates his brother for risking his life \"for a bunch of strangers.\" The flashback reveals that Sonny introduced Carlo to Connie and the rest of the family, hence their later marriage.Vincent Mancini, who eventually succeeded Michael as head of the Corleone family, is the illegitimate son of Sonny and Lucy Mancini in The Godfather Part III. Vincent does not exist in the books, as it was specifically mentioned in Puzo's original novel that Lucy never bore a son with Sonny.","Peter Clemenza (1890 - 1958) is a fictional character appearing in Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather and two of the three films based on it.In his young adulthood, in The Godfather Part II, Clemenza is portrayed by Bruno Kirby. In his later years, he is portrayed by Richard S. Castellano.Peter Clemenza is one of two (later three) caporegimes in the Corleone Family (the other being Salvatore Tessio). He rules over the family's territory in The Bronx. Although he is less intelligent than his friend and counterpart Tessio, he is said to be more brutal and direct in the book. In the film, he may be perceived at first as a fat, dim witted thug, but later on he is shown to be a formidable assassin.Clemenza became a friend of Vito Corleone after immigrating from Sicily, when Corleone held a package of guns for him to prevent their discovery by the police. Although he is a native of Italy, and in The Godfather II is shown speaking perfect colloquial Italian as a young man in his 20s, in The Godfather an older Clemenza speaks with a highly pronounced New York\/Brooklyn accent. One of the few remaining hints of his Italian roots is that he pronounces \"Corleone\" as \"Cor-yon-nay.\"A friendly and jovial man, he was known as a storyteller among many of his acquaintances and family members - a trait that endeared him to Vito Corleone, whom Puzo described as \"a listener to storytellers.\" Clemenza got his start selling stolen goods such as dresses and guns with Vito and Tessio as far back as 1917 and became a key figure in the growing Corleone family.Vito kept him close through the years. For instance, Vito makes Clemenza godfather to his oldest son Sonny, and handled Sonny's training once Sonny decided to join his father's family. However, this was to control his brutal and more ambitious tendencies (even though he had mellowed somewhat in a decade of peace between the families).Clemenza plays a key role in aiding Michael following the shooting of Vito. He retrains Michael how to fire a gun, walking him through the scenario for assassinating Virgil Sollozzo, and gets someone to plant the gun prior to the assassination. In the wave of killings that cements Michael's power, Clemenza garroted Carlo Rizzi for his role in setting up Sonny for assassination. During the murders of the heads of the Five Families in the film, Clemenza personally shot Don Stracci and his bodyguard. It is Clemenza's greeting of Michael as \"Don Michael\" at the end of the book (as \"Don Corleone\" at the end of the film) that convinces Kay Adams-Corleone that her husband has become as ruthless as his father.Clemenza's forces include soldiers Paulie Gatto, Willi Cicci, Al Neri, Rocco Lampone and Aldo Trapani. He handled many of his men closely, proud of picking Lampone as a caporegime and locating Neri as a successor to Luca Brasi. He could also be cruel with them - when he found out that Gatto had been collaborating with Sollozo, he saw it as a personal betrayal and orchestrated the execution personally, with Rocco pulling the trigger.Ironically, clemenza literally means \"mercy\" or \"forgiveness\" in Italian. The English cognate is clemency.In Mark Winegardner's novel The Godfather Returns, Clemenza stands in as consigliere at Commission meetings during the course of the book (since Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere and he is also not Sicilian, so hecannot be involved in these meetings.) He died of a heart attack shortly before 1958, a consequence of his excessive lifestyle - an autopsy revealed his heart was \"twice the size of a normal man's.\" In the film The Godfather: Part II, Willie Cicci, appears to deny this, stating \"that was no heart attack\" but no further info is given. Pete Clemenza was succeeded as caporegime by Frank Pentangeli.In Puzo's novel The Sicilian, Clemenza is featured in Sicily, where he meets Michael Corleone in order to arrange his safe return to America and also to oversee the safe passage of the novel's lead character, Salvatore Guiliano. In this novel he has an older brother, Domenic Clemenza, who is an old-fashioned and well respected Mafia Don. Neither Clemenza nor Michael Corleone are featured in the film version of the novel, presumably because of copyright restrictions on the Godfather film franchise.Clemenza was originally supposed to return in The Godfather Part II. However, Castellano demanded that he write all of Clemenza's lines himself, along with a large salary increase.[citation needed] Director Francis Ford Coppola refused and had Clemenza killed instead, replacing him with Frank Pentangeli.Richard S. Castellano and Bruno Kirby appeared together in a television series entitled The Super, in which they played a father and son.","Joining the FamilyTom Hagen was orphaned as a child and spent an entire winter on the streets of New York. He then met Sonny, who brought him home with him. The Corleone family took Tom in and Vito had a doctor cure him of an eye infection he had picked up from his late mother. Vito urged Tom not to take on the family name as a show of respect to his late parents; nevertheless Tom became fully integrated into the family.PersonalityThough his late childhood on the streets forced him to develop life-preserving survival skills, the adult Tom rarely if ever shows passion outwardly. He is happily married to a woman he respects and even admires (see The Godfathers Revenge), but also has a mistress. We learn repeatedly that he has little or no interest in entertainment or entertainers, even though the Corleone Family does a great deal of business in Hollywood. The novels reveal that he paid close attention to Vito Corleone while growing up and learned well his skills at analyzing the subtleties of human behavior (as well as the Sicilian dialect). Tom sees as one of his greatest assets his ability to blend in in the \"outside world\" (see The Godfather Returns), since his manner is so lacking in any kind of ostentation. He is thus able to accomplish things in the public sphere such as scanning a small town's records to find birth certificates his associates could use for false identities and leave almost no trace in the memories of those around him.The GodfatherAfter Connie Corleone's wedding, Hagen is dispatched by Vito Corleone to Hollywood in order to convince Jack Woltz, a big-time movie studio head, to give singer\/actor Johnny Fontane (Vito's godson) the lead role in his new war film. When he first approaches Woltz, he offers help with some union trouble. Hagen then tells Waltz that one of his actors has moved from marijuana to heroin. A deleted scene in the movie shows that this information was going to be used to expose the star and thus hurt Woltz's studio.[1] Woltz at first angrily refuses, but becomes more cordial once he finds out who Hagen works for. Woltz invites him over to his palatial estate for dinner, and shows him his prized stud horse, Khartoum. During the dinner, Woltz tries to work out another deal with Hagen, but refuses to cast Fontane, who had slept with one of his mistresses. Men working for the Corleones break into Woltz's stables and decapitate Khartoum, and place the horse's severed head and a large amount of its blood in Woltz's bed. The next day Hagen receives a call from a ranting Woltz, who threatens to bring the law down on the Corleones' heads. Hagen gives a nonchalant response and hangs up. Shortly afterwards, Woltz gives Fontane the coveted role.Hagen later compiles information on drug lord Virgil \"the Turk\" Sollozzo, who had approached Vito Corleone on behalf of the Tattaglia crime family to help fund and provide political protection for a heroin operation in New York, in exchange for 30 percent of the profits. Vito, after considering his options, refuses the Turk's proposal, though Sonny shows a slight interest.That December, Hagen is abducted by the Turk and his bodyguards. At an undisclosed location, Sollozzo informs Hagen that Don Corleone has been shot and killed, and tells Hagen to convince Sonny to go along with the original deal. Hagen promises to calm Sonny down, but warns the Turk about inevitable reprisal from Luca Brasi, the Don's fanatically loyal bodyguard and hitman. Unbeknownst to Hagen, Brasi was killed by Sollozzo and Bruno Tattaglia. The meeting is interrupted when Sollozzo receives word that Don Corleone survived the shooting, which ruins all of Sollozo's plans, as Sonny would listen to no deal while his father was still alive.While he loves all the Corleones, Hagen idolizes Sonny, and so blames himself when Sonny is murdered by the Barzinis. After becoming the new head of the family, Michael Corleone removes Hagen as consigliere, restricting him to handling the Family's legal business in Nevada, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Hagen accepts the decision, and remains loyal. However, after Vito's death, Hagen resumes his role as consigliere.The Godfather: Part IIAfter an attempt on Michael's life in The Godfather, Part II, Hagen takes over as acting Don while Michael tries to find out who in his organization had betrayed him and aided the assassins. Hagen is instrumental in both securing the friendship of powerful Senator Pat Geary and defending Michael during the Senate hearings on the Mafia.The fall of Fulgencio Batista's regime in Cuba forces Michael to abandon his dream of becoming a legitimate businessman and retake his place as the Don of the Corleone family. As a result, he gives Hagen back his old position as consigliere.Even as Michael becomes increasingly ruthless and paranoid, Hagen dutifully fulfills his role as not just a legal adviser but a dispassionate envoy for the Family. For example, he gives Frank Pentangeli, who had betrayed Michael, the \"option\" of committing suicide so that Pentangeli's family would continue to be taken care of after his death.The Godfather: Part IIIAccording to The Godfather: Part III, Hagen dies at some point prior to the timeframe of the film, 1979-1980. There is no specific indication in the film as to when or how he dies, except that it is before the ordination of his son, Andrew, a Roman Catholic priest.The Godfather's RevengeMark Winegardner's sequel The Godfather's Revenge explains that Hagen is murdered in August 1964 by former Corleone underboss Nick Geraci, who drowns him in the Florida Everglades. Geraci then sends Michael a package containing a dead baby alligator along with Hagen's wallet, a message similar to the one that is sent to Sonny in the original novel following Luca Brasi's death.Behind the scenesThe Hagen character was originally intended to have been featured in The Godfather, Part III, but was written out because of a financial disagreement between Duvall and the film's producers. Coppola has stated that Part III was originally planned to feature a split between Michael and Hagen as its central plot. Coppola stated in the film's commentary that Duvall demanded the same salary as Al Pacino (who portrayed Michael Corleone).FamilyVito Corleone (Marlon Brando) - Unofficial adopted father Carmella Corleone - Unofficial adopted mother Santino 'Sonny' Corleone (James Caan) - Unofficial adopted brother Theresa Hagen - Wife Frank and Andrew Hagen (Roman Coppola and Gian-Carlo Coppola) - Sons","Captain Mark McCluskey is a fictional character from 'The Godfather', he is New York City police captain in the 40's.In the film, he is quickly revealed to be very mean and corrupt, being a key person on the Tattaglia's payroll.When some enforcers of the Corleone family protect Don Vito Corleone, McCluskey has them taken away.\nMichael arrives soon after and realizes this.\nSoon after, while Michael is guarding the entrance of the hospital with Enzo the baker, McCluskey and his guys drive up and harrass the two, ordering that they be taken in.

In the film, he is portrayed by John Marley.Woltz is a Jewish movie producer who refuses to cast the singer\/actor Johnny Fontane, who had slept with one of his mistresses, in a movie. Fontane asks Don Vito Corleone, who is the head of an organized crime family and his godfather, to lean on Woltz. Corleone sends his consigliere, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), to Hollywood to \"reason\" with Woltz.Hagen offers to help Woltz with union trouble in return for casting Fontane. Woltz loses his temper, shouting anti-Italian slurs at Hagen, and refuses to bargain. Later, after learning exactly who Hagen works for, he appears more eager to listen, but in the end still refuses to cast Fontane. Woltz is finally persuaded when he wakes up the next morning to find the decapitated head of his prized racehorse, Khartoum, in his bed.In the novel, Woltz is portrayed as a man who has achieved great success in the film industry, having come up from nothing. During World War II he became the White House's propaganda adviser, obtaining a large government contract as well as political contacts in the process, as well as an acquaintance with J. Edgar Hoover. It is also revealed that he is a pedophile who routinely molests young girls who audition for his movies, as well as the daughters of some of his actresses. (Although this aspect of the character is left out of the feature, it can be viewed in a deleted scene).When Johnny Fontane is nominated for an Academy Award for his role in the film, a spiteful Woltz bribes or threatens nearly everyone in Hollywood to keep him from winning. He is again thwarted by the Corleone Family, and Fontane wins, eventually opening a Corleone-funded movie studio that soon rivals Woltz Pictures.In the game The Godfather: The Game, for one of the stages the player is sent on a mission to Hollywood. Being outside of New York City, he has no map to rely on. The player is ordered by Tom Hagen to decapitate Khartoum's head, with the help of Rocco Lampone, a Corleone soldate. The player then must sneak the head into Woltz's bedroom, all the while being quiet enough so as not to alert any of the security guards or cleaning ladies who are employed by Woltz. Successfully completing the stage will show a reenactment of the infamous \"horse head\" scene.","null","Salvatore \"Sal\" Tessio (1890-1955) is a fictional character in Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather and the film based on it. In the film, Tessio was portrayed by Abe Vigoda, and as a younger man in the sequel by John Aprea.Tessio began with his friends Peter Clemenza and Vito Corleone as low-level hoodlums in New York City's Little Italy. As Corleone rose to prominence in the Mafia underworld, Tessio and Clemenza rose with him, each eventually settling into the caporegime roles. Tessio owned the Embassy Club in Brooklyn and made it his base of operations. From there, he managed his Mafia soldiers and was very well-connected throughout the borough. Most federal investigators considered Tessio the smarter, savvier and more ruthless of the two capos. However, according to the book, he had mellowed considerably over the decade of peace between New York's Mafia families.His regime included soldiers Nick Geraci, Momo Barone, Eddie Paradise, and Tommy Neri. He was initially the more trusted of the two capos during the war with the Five Families, and was issued the task of assassinating Bruno Tattaglia. He never really trusted Michael Corleone after he took over the family, although he thought more of the young don than did Clemenza and Tom Hagen. Ultimately, Tessio arranged for Michael's assassination at a peace summit set up by his enemies, Emilio Barzini and Philip Tattaglia. In return, Tessio would inherit the Corleone family upon Michael's death.At Vito's funeral, Tessio told Michael that he's set up the peace summit, to be held on his territory in Brooklyn. However, Michael had anticipated the plot by way of a warning from his father, who intimated that the person who approached him about the peace summit would be the family traitor. Tessio's betrayal came as a surprise to Hagen, who thought Clemenza would be the turncoat. However, Michael wasn't surprised, saying \"Tessio was smarter.\"A few days later, Tessio was ready to head for Brooklyn with Hagen when one of the members of his regime tells him that Michael is going in a separate car. Tessio is frustrated, saying that it's messed up his \"arrangements.\" At that point, Hagen tells Tessio he can't go either, and several button men surround Tessio. Realizing that Michael has found out about his betrayal, Tessio asked Hagen to tell Michael that his betrayal was not motivated by any personal animosity but simply business. Tessio was executed with a gunshot at point blank range by his enforcer Nick Geraci in the book The Godfather Returns. According to this book, Geraci succeeded him as capo, but in the original book, Al Neri took over the old Tessio regime.In the video game adaptation, Tessio is escorted to the place where he was to betray Michael by the game's protagonist. He subsequently fled, but was hunted down and shot by the enforcer.","Fredo Corleone (1919-1959) is the middle son of Don Vito Corleone and Carmella Corleone.Siblings: Santino Corleone (1916-1948) (assassination) Tom Hagen (1910-1964) (murder) Michael Corleone (1920-1997) (age) Connie Corleone.Fredo Corleone was born in 1919 in Hell's Kitchen, New York City, New York to Vito and Carmella Corleone.

He is the youngest brother of Sonny and Fredo, and the older brother of Connie.The Godfather: Part IMichael Corleone's ascension to the head of the Corleone crime family is portrayed in Puzo's novel and the first film.Michael initially wants nothing to do with the \"family business\", and is enrolled at Dartmouth College in search of a more Americanized life. After the United States' entry into World War II, he enlists in the Marines against his father's wishes and fights in the Pacific Theatre. For his bravery, Michael is featured in Life magazine in 1944, having been awarded the Navy Cross. Michael is discharged as a Captain to recover from wounds in 1945. He later re-enters Dartmouth, where he meets his future wife, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton).When his father is nearly assassinated in 1945, he volunteers to murder the man responsible, Virgil \"The Turk\" Sollozzo (Al Lettieri). He also proposes to kill Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), a police captain who removed his father's bodyguards from the hospital, presumably to set up his father to be killed. Although it is normally a hard-and-fast rule in the Mafia that law enforcement officials are not to be harmed, Michael successfully convinces his older brother Sonny (James Caan) that since McCluskey is serving as Sollozzo's bodyguard, he has crossed into their world and is fair game.After committing the murders, Michael flees to Sicily under the protection of Don Tommasino, a longtime friend of his father's, and stays in exile for two years. While in Sicily, he marries a young woman named Apollonia (Simonetta Stefanelli), but she is killed by a car bomb intended for Michael. Fabrizio, one of his bodyguards, was paid by a rival family to plant the bomb.While in Sicily, he learns that Sonny had been murdered, and he returns to New York in 1950. There, he reluctantly becomes involved in his family's criminal enterprises, taking over for his deceased brother as operating head of the family under Vito's supervision. The family's consigliere, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and one of the caporegimes, Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano), are somewhat skeptical of his ability, but the other capo, Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda), thinks somewhat more of him. He marries Kay a year later, promising to make the family legitimate within five years.Michael tries to buy a casino from Moe Greene (Alex Rocco) the casino is partly owned \"off the record\" by the Corleone family. He intends to move his family to Nevada. After his father's death in 1955, he becomes official Don of the Corleone crime family. Before his death, Vito had warned Michael that after he was gone, the head of the rival Barzini family would make an attempt on his life under the pretense of organizing a meeting in order to make peace. After Tessio inadvertently reveals that he had conspired with Emilio Barzini (Richard Conte) against him, Michael arranges the murders of Barzini and Philip Tattaglia. In the film, he also kills the other two Mafia chiefs, Carmine Cuneo, and Victor Stracci. Also targeted are Greene, Tessio, Fabrizio and Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), his brother-in-law, who plotted with Barzini to have Sonny killed. With this violent attack, Michael cements his reputation and returns the Corleone family to its position as the most powerful crime family in New York.When his sister Connie (Talia Shire) finds out that Michael had Carlo killed while he stood godfather to their baby, she flies into a rage. Michael dismisses it as hysteria, and when pressed by Kay, denies any involvement in the murder. Just minutes later, however, he meets with his capos, and Clemenza greets him as \"Don Michael.\" In the film, Clemenza greets Michael as \"Don Corleone\" and kisses his hand. Unknown to Michael, Kay is watching this meeting, and realizes that Connie was telling the truth after all and that her husband has become the new Don Corleone.Parallel story: The Sicilian (novel only)\nMichael appears as a secondary character in Puzo's The Sicilian. During his two-year exile in Sicily, Michael is eager to return home to his family in New York, but is told by Clemenza that his father wants him to escort Salvatore \"Turi\" Guiliano safely back to America with him. As he learns more about the reputation and exploits of the legendary Guiliano, Michael becomes extremely intrigued to meet him, but Giuliano dies before the meeting can take place.The Godfather: Part IIBy the time of The Godfather Part II, Michael has moved to shake off his family's Mafia roots. Frank Pentangeli, a longtime associate of his father's, has taken over the family's operations in New York.His efforts at going legitimate prove unsuccessful, however, as his enemies keep him involved in the underworld. He begins to work out a deal with business partner and rival Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) over control of casino operations, but Roth manipulates Michael's brother Fredo (John Cazale) into unwittingly providing him with information used to arrange an attempt on Michael's life.Michael and Roth travel to Cuba to forge a partnership with Fulgencio Batista's regime, allowing them to conduct their operations freely. In the midst of the revolution of 1959, Michael discovers that Fredo has betrayed him.Back home, Kay reveals she has aborted their child because she does not want to bring another son of his into the world. Michael divorces Kay and severs ties with her.Following the death of their mother, Michael orders Fredo's murder, an act he would regret for the rest of his life.The Godfather: Part IIIBy the time of The Godfather Part III (the late 1970s) Michael has taken great steps to making the family legitimate; he is preparing to hand over his interests in gambling to the other Mafia families, setting up a charitable foundation, and is even being recognized by the Vatican for his good works. This new connection to the Church gives Michael the opportunity to purchase a controlling stake in the large property conglomerate, Immobiliare. He also begins to rekindle his relationship with Kay, as well as taking Sonny's illegitimate son, Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), under his wing. He finds himself pulled back into the underworld, however, when almost the entire Mafia Commission is wiped out by an assassin as Michael prepares to hand over his criminal interests. Vinnie responds to this new threat against the Family with brutal violence, publicly gunning down Michael's rival, Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna), who was thought to have ordered the hit on Michael. Vinnie also begins a relationship with Michael's daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola), a romance Michael strongly disapproves of.At the end of the film, weary of the bloody, lonely life of a Don, he retires and makes his nephew the new head of the family, on condition that he end the relationship with Mary. Realizing that powerful interests in Italian politics and business were working to prevent the family's takeover of Immobiliare, Michael, with Vinnie's assistance, once again prepares to move against his enemies. This wave of murders takes place as Michael watches his son Anthony (Franc D'Ambrosio) perform in the opera Cavalleria Rusticana. That same night, however, Mary is inadvertently killed in an assassination attempt on Michael himself. Devastated by this loss, Michael withdraws from life and retires to Sicily, where he dies years later (1997) of a diabetic stroke, sitting alone in a lawn chair.","Joining the FamilyTom Hagen was orphaned as a child and spent an entire winter on the streets of New York. He then met Sonny, who brought him home with him. The Corleone family took Tom in and Vito had a doctor cure him of an eye infection he had picked up from his late mother. Vito urged Tom not to take on the family name as a show of respect to his late parents; nevertheless Tom became fully integrated into the family.PersonalityThough his late childhood on the streets forced him to develop life-preserving survival skills, the adult Tom rarely if ever shows passion outwardly. He is happily married to a woman he respects and even admires (see The Godfathers Revenge), but also has a mistress. We learn repeatedly that he has little or no interest in entertainment or entertainers, even though the Corleone Family does a great deal of business in Hollywood. The novels reveal that he paid close attention to Vito Corleone while growing up and learned well his skills at analyzing the subtleties of human behavior (as well as the Sicilian dialect).

Though composed of characteristics of many gangsters, the Vito Corleone character is based largely on those of Frank Costello and Carlo Gambino. Like Costello, Vito has a raspy voice, has politicians and judges on his payroll, and has many gambling interests. Like Gambino, Vito is very cunning.In Puzo's novel, Vito is the head of the Corleone crime family, the most powerful Mafia family in the New York City area if not the country. He is depicted as an ambitious Italian immigrant who moves to Hell's Kitchen and builds a Mafia empire, yet retains (and strictly adheres to) his own personal code of honor. His youngest son, Michael Corleone, becomes the Don upon his death at the end of the novel. He has two other sons, Santino \"Sonny\" Corleone and Fredo Corleone, and a daughter, Connie Corleone, all of whom play major roles in the story. He also informally adopted another son, Tom Hagen, who grew up to become the Family's consigliere.Early lifeIn the chronology of the Godfather saga, Vito first appears in 1901 as a young boy in the small Sicilian town of Corleone. As documented in the novel (and in Godfather Part II), his father, Antonio Andolini, is murdered by the local Mafia boss, Don Ciccio, because he refused to pay tribute to him. His older brother, Paolo, swears revenge, but is himself murdered soon after. Eventually, Ciccio's henchmen come to the residence of the Andolinis to take Vito away and have him killed. Desperate, Signora Andolini takes her son to see the mafia chieftain herselfImmigration to AmericaWhen Vito's mother goes to see Don Ciccio, she begs him to spare Vito. However, Ciccio refuses, reasoning that Vito would also seek revenge as an adult. Upon Ciccio's refusal, Signora Andolini puts a knife to his throat, allowing her son to escape, but is then murdered by Ciccio's guards. (In the novel, she survives being shot and later reunites with her son in Sicily many years later.) Later that night, he is smuggled away, fleeing Sicily to seek refuge in America on a cargo ship full of immigrants. In the novel, he deliberately changes his name to Corleone, after his home town. The movie, however, plays that he is renamed \"Vito Corleone\" because the immigration workers at Ellis Island mistake \"Andolini\" for his middle name and the name of his town for his last name. According to The Godfather: Part II, he later adopted the middle name \"Andolini\" to acknowledge his heritage, though this could have been done posthumously by his family.Adopted by the Abbandando familyCorleone is later adopted by the Abbandando family in New York City's Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, and he befriends their son, Genco, who becomes like a brother to him. Corleone begins making an honest living at Abbandando's grocery store on Ninth Avenue, but loses the job, as an intimidated Abbandando is forced to fire Vito to make room for the nephew of Don Fanucci, a blackhander and the local neighborhood padrone.Corleone soon learns to survive and prosper through petty crime and performing favors in return for loyalty. During this time, he also befriends two other low-level hoods, Peter Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio. In 1919, he commits his first murder, killing Fanucci, who had tried to extort money from him. Corleone chooses the day of a major festival to spy on Fanucci from the rooftops as Fanucci goes home, and surprises him at the door to his apartment. He shoots Fanucci three times, as the din from the festival drowns out the noise from the gunshots.Rise as an olive oil importerAs a young man, Corleone starts an olive oil business, Genco Pura (known as simply Genco Olive Oil in the films) with his friend Genco Abbandando. The company eventually becomes the biggest olive oil importer in the nation. Over the years he uses it as a legal front for his organized crime syndicate, while amassing a fortune with his illegal operations. In 1925, he returns to Sicily for the first time since leaving 24 years earlier. He and his partner, Don Tommasino then set up a meeting with the aging Don Ciccio, where he kills him by carving his stomach open, thus avenging his murdered father, mother and brother.Organized CrimeBy the early 1930s, Vito Corleone has organized his illegal operations as the Corleone crime family. Genco Abbandando becomes his consigliere, or advisor, with Clemenza and Tessio as capo regimes. Later, his son Sonny becomes a capo as well, and eventually his under-boss. Around 1939, he moves his base of operations to Long Beach, on Long Island. While he oversees a business founded on gambling, bootlegging, and union corruption, he is known as a kind, generous man who lives by a strict moral code of loyalty to friends and, above all, family. At the same time, he is known as a traditionalist who demands respect commensurate with his status. By the time of the novel and film, even his three closest friends Genco, Pete and Salnever call him \"Vito,\" but either \"Godfather\" or \"Don Corleone.\" In both the book and the first scene of the first Godfather, he chastises his old friend, undertaker Bonasera, for not coming to him first after his daughter is beaten up instead of going to the police. Although he has a reputation for ruthlessness, he disagrees with many of the vicious crimes carried out by gangs and so seeks to control crime in New York by either consuming or eliminating rival gangs. In the mid-1920s, Vito met Hyman Roth (based on real life Jewish mobster Meyer Lansky), who wanted to use Vito's trucks for his own smuggling operation. Vito accepted this offer, and the two became allies for many years.Assassination AttemptIn 1945, Corleone is nearly assassinated when he refuses the request of Virgil Sollozzo to invest in a heroin operation and use his political contacts for the operation's protection. He is supposed to be driven home by his bodyguard, Paulie Gatto (a soldier in the Clemenza regime) along with his son Fredo. When the Don finds that Paulie is not there, Fredo tells him that Paulie has called in sick that day due to a cold. The Don crosses the street to buy oranges and other fruits from a street vendor. At that time, two of Sollozzo's hitmen come out from the shadows with guns drawn. Realizing the situation, the Don tries to sprint back to his Alfa Romeo but he is shot five times in his thighs and arms. Fredo tries to help his father, but fumbles with his gun and can't get to him in time.Certain that the Don is dead, Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen and tells him to get Sonny to accept the drug deal. Hagen agrees, but warns Sollozzo that the Don's fanatically loyal hitman, Luca Brasi, will likely come after Sollozzo. However, Sollozzo doesn't tell Hagen that he helped kill Brasi earlier.Just as Hagen is released, Sollozzo finds out the Don survived. Enraged, he makes a second attempt two days later. The Don is at the French Hospital being guarded by men from Tessio's regime. However, Sollozzo has police Captain Mark McCluskey, who has been on the take for many years, threw Tessio's men in jail, leaving the Don unguarded. Unfortunately for Sollozzo and McCluskey, Michael comes to visit his father just minutes before the attack is due. Realizing that his father is in danger, Michael has a nurse help him move the Don to another room and pretends to stand guard outside the hospital with Enzo the baker.Injuries from the attack put the Don out of action for next three years. Sonny served as acting head of the family during this time. He determined that Paulie Gatto took money from Sollozzo in return for betraying the Don, and ordered him killed. He also got word that the Tattaglias had killed Luca Brasi, and ordered Tessio's men to kill the family's underboss, Bruno Tattaglia. Michael persuaded Sonny to allow him to avenge their father by killing Sollozzo and McCluskey himself.Sonny's death and Vito's returnSonny was himself assassinated, forcing Vito to resume command. He ordered all inquiries made, yet also ordered that no vengeance shall be sought. With the Don incapacitated, the other families had moved in on his business interests, as well as his labor rackets. With the Don's return, rival families now started reconsidering their moves.After Sonny's funeral and other formalities, Vito ordered Hagen to contact Emilio Barzini, the second most powerful Mafia chieftain in the country, in order to arrange a meeting of heads of all the families in America except the Chicago Outfit (considered the \"black sheep\" of the underworld). The meeting took place in the board room of a Manhattan bank whose president was a close friend of the Corleones.In that meeting, Vito renounced all vengeance regarding his son's death. He also said a light yes to the drug operations although he mentioned he never believed in drugs. However, he said he only accepted this for \"selfish reasons\" in order to bring back Michael from exile in Sicily.In this part he said,\"But let me say this. I am a superstitious man, a ridiculous failing but I must confess it here. And so if some unlucky accident should befall my youngest son, if some police officer should accidentally shoot him, if he should hang himself while in his jail cell, if new witnesses appear to testify to his guilt, my superstition will make me feel that it was the result of the ill will still borne me by some people here. Let me go further. If my son is struck by a bolt of lightning I will blame some of the people here. If his plane show fall into the sea or his ship sink beneath the waves of the ocean, if he should catch a mortal fever, if his automobile should be struck by a train, such is my superstition that I would blame the ill will felt by people here.\"RetirementAfter Michael's return from Sicily, Vito installed him in the family business as a learner associate. Michael learned things from his father for more than a year. After Michael's marriage with earlier girlfriend Kay Adams, Vito went into semi-retirement. Michael became operating head of the family, with Vito as an informal consigliere. Michael sent Hagen to Las Vegas to act as the family's lawyer there and lay the groundwork for a planned move of most operations there after Vito's death. Clemenza and Tessio requested permission to break off and form their own families after the move to Las Vegas. Michael's bodyguard Albert 'Al' Neri and Rocco Lampone were chosen to be the future capo regimes of the family. Willi Cicci was also considered, but opted to go with Clemenza's planned family.DeathAt the end of the novel and in the movie, he dies of a heart attack while playing with his grandson Anthony in his garden. His last words in the novel are, \"Life is so beautiful.\" Vito's funeral was a grand affair, with all the other dons, capos and consiglieres in New York attending.Vito told Michael some days before his death that Barzini would set Michael up to be killed under cover of a meeting \"to fix up things.\" Barzini would use a trusted member of the Corleone family as an intermediary. At the funeral, Tessio told Michael that he'd set up a meeting on his territory in Brooklyn, where Michael would presumably be safe. However, Michael had anticipated this and had Tessio killed. Michael then ordered his men to kill Barzini and Tattaglia (in the film, the other two family chiefs as well), thus avenging his father and brother.","Fredo Corleone (1919-1959) is the middle son of Don Vito Corleone and Carmella Corleone.Siblings: Santino Corleone (1916-1948) (assassination) Tom Hagen (1910-1964) (murder) Michael Corleone (1920-1997) (age) Connie Corleone.Fredo Corleone was born in 1919 in Hell's Kitchen, New York City, New York to Vito and Carmella Corleone. In 1920, Fredo had pneumonia that lasted throughtout the year. He first realized the truth of his father's business in the 1930s. His father ran the most powerful crime syndicate in New York City and in 1936, Fredo joined the business. In 1945, Don Vito survived an attempt on his life in which Fredo witnessed. Because of it, a war broke out that led to the death of his older brother Santino. The war ended in 1948 and Don Vito retired the year after. His younger brother Michael became the Don. The family moved to Nevada in 1955 after the death of his father Don Vito. The business ruled casinos in Las Vegas and supported the government in Cuba. In 1958, Fredo betrayed his family by working with the enemy. Because of his misdeeds, he was banned from the business forever. In 1959, his younger brother ordered his assassination.","Constanzia Corleone Rizzi, usually known as Connie Corleone, is a fictional character from The Godfather by Mario Puzo. In the films, Connie is portrayed by Talia Shire, who is the sister of director Francis Ford Coppola.Connie was born in 1923 as the youngest child, and only daughter, of Don Vito Corleone and Carmella Corleone. She is the sister of Sonny, Fredo and Michael Corleone. She married Carlo Rizzi, a smalltime hood from Nevada. This choice (and the fact that Carlo is of northern Italian descent) greatly displeased her father, who only agreed to the marriage on condition that they hold an old-style Sicilian wedding.Rizzi regularly abused and cheated on Connie to demonstrate his power over the Corleones. She complained to her parents, but her father refused to help, presumably to punish Connie. In truth, Vito was very upset at how Connie was being treated, but Italian tradition at the time forbade a father--even one as powerful as Vito--from interfering in his daughter's marriage. When she complained to Sonny, he beat Carlo until Connie begged him off.A few months later, however, Carlo gave Connie a particularly severe beating. Sonny got wind of it, and beat up Carlo mercilessly in the street, threatening to kill him if he ever laid a hand on Connie again. An enraged Carlo then schemed with her brother's and father's rivals, Philip Tattaglia and Emilio Barzini, to have Sonny killed. As part of the plan, Carlo once again beat Connie badly, this time in order to ambush Sonny. Connie called Sonny in a state of terror, and he drove to Connie's place; while en route he was ambushed and assassinated. Later, Michael took revenge by having Carlo killed (by Peter Clemenza) after standing as godfather to their second child. This angered Connie (who apparently didn't know about her husband's role in Sonny's death) and she resented him for many years afterward.In the novel The Godfather, Connie at first berated Michael for Carlo Rizzi's death but a week later apologized to her brother, claiming she didn't really mean it. She married less than a year later, not fulfilling the widow's mandate of respecting the memory of her late husband.Her role in the films continues in the sequels, The Godfather, Part II, where she is shown to be the youngest of the four Corleone children, and in The Godfather, Part III.In the years since Carlo's death, she had a series of meaningless affairs and marriages just to spite Michael, even borrowing money and abandoning her children temporarily, but returned to the family after their mother died, and becomes more involved in the family business. Toward the end of Part II, she is seen kissing her brother's hand.She had two sons by Rizzi, Victor and Michael Francis. A brief glimpse in Mama Corleone's funeral scene is the only time that Victor appears in the trilogy. While Michael was standing as godfather to Michael Francis, the other heads of the Five Families are killed in a massive slaughter that reestablishes the Corleone family's reputation.In Part III Connie became a much more active member of Michael's inner circle, and was perhaps the closest he had to a true consigliere in the film. She was instrumental in persuading Michael to take their nephew Vincent under his wing and groom him as the new Don, and it was she who ordered Vincent to kill Joey Zaza. She also poisoned Don Altobello, her godfather, in retaliation for his attempted assault on the family, though it caused her visible grief to do so.In The Godfather Part III it is indicated that she thinks Fredo has drowned, not murdered on Michael's orders. Some critics thought this lacked credibility given that Connie was fully aware of Michael's ruthlessness, especially after Carlo's death. It can, however, be argued that she was simply in denial, or that it was perhaps her way of telling Michael that she forgave him for what he did.Connie appears in Mark Winegardner's sequel novels The Godfather Returns and The Godfather's Revenge.","Hyman Roth (1891-1960) is a fictional character, based heavily on real-life gangster Meyer Lansky, who plays a pivotal role in the film The Godfather Part II. He was portrayed by Lee Strasberg, a well-respected acting teacher, in one of his few screen roles.As of Godfather II, Hyman Roth is a boss of the Jewish mob and has long been an associate of the Corleone family, though he is not mentioned in the first film or in the book on which it is based.The character's original name of Hyman Suchowsky, based on Lansky's birth name of Suchowliski, is thought unsuitable for the Corleone family. Clemenza suggests \"Johnny Lips\" as his new name, but Vito Corleone feels that the young man should have some say in the choice. When Vito discovers that Hyman greatly admires gambler Arnold Rothstein, he is given the name Hyman Rothstein, which is later shortened to Roth. Though this scene was cut from the theatrical version of the film, the Roth character makes reference to the conversation in another scene, one that takes place much later in his life, in which he tells Michael Corleone, \"I've loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series in 1919.\" (The original cut scene was one of the many that was restored for The Godfather Saga.)The young Hyman Roth (who, in the theatrical release, can be spotted as the curly-haired young man outside Genco headquarters when the companys sign is being put into place), was played by John Megna, best known for his portrayal of Dill in the film To Kill a Mockingbird.Roth worked diligently for the Corleone Family during Prohibition, and was a close friend and ally of Moe Greene, a character based on Bugsy Siegel, the \"inventor\" of Las Vegas. It is also suggested, however, that Vito Corleone never fully trusted Roth.As Part II opens, Roth is based in Miami and lives like a typically quiet, middle-class Jewish man approaching old age though in reality he is by now a wealthy and very powerful crime boss. His right hand man is the Sicilian Johnny Ola, played by Dominic Chianese. Roth, though in ill health, is about to enter into an extraordinarily profitable business partnership with the corrupt Cuban government, but is thwarted by Fidel Castros Communist revolution. At about this time, Roth manipulates Michael's brother Fredo into giving him information he uses to make an attempt on Michael's life.During the last night of Batista's leadership, Michael, who has known that Roth has betrayed him, decides that \"Roth [would] not see the New Year\". After ordering the murder of Johnny Ola in the same night, Michael has his bodyguard try to kill Roth. Roth is ill and lying in bed when Michael's bodyguard sneaks in and tries to suffocate Roth with a pillow. Fortunately for Roth, members of the military storm the hospital and kill the bodyguard.By the end of the movie, Roth publicly states that he wishes to retire and live the twilight of his life in Israel which is a sign that he gives up the feud against the Corleones. But Michael is not satisfied yet. As Roth returns from Israel, having had his request to live there \"as a Jew in the twilight of [his] life\" refused by the Israeli High Court, he arrives at the airport and prepares to be taken into federal custody in the U.S. However, he is assassinated by Corleone caporegime Rocco Lampone, posing as a reporter, who is in turn shot by police as he attempts to flee the scene. The camera shot of Roth's last moments of life is based on a photograph of Meyer Lansky taken in his old age. The staging of his assassination also appears to have been based on Jack Ruby's assassination of Lee Harvey Oswald, including Rocco's posing as a reporter.","Frank Pentangeli (\"Frankie Five Angels\") is a fictional character from the film The Godfather Part II. In the film, he was portrayed by Michael V. Gazzo, who was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance. It has been suggested that Pentangeli was based on the famed Mafia informant Joseph Valachi, though this has not been confirmed.He was born in Partinico, a small town outside of Palermo, Sicily. Pentangeli is a caporegime in the Corleone family, running the family's operations in New York City while Michael and Fredo Corleone are in Nevada. He took over the position following the death of the previous capo, Peter Clemenza. Pentangeli is a very old associate and family friend, having worked with Vito Corleone in the early days of their olive oil business. He now lives in Vito's former estate on Long Island.Near the beginning of the story, Pentangeli approaches Michael to ask for his help in eliminating the Rosato brothers, rivals in New York, who claimed to have been promised territories by Peter Clemenza prior to his death, but Michael refuses. He orders Pentangeli to do nothing, as he does not want a war to interfere with an upcoming deal with Hyman Roth, who supports the Rosatos. Pentangeli takes this as an insult and leaves in anger. Later that night, Michael narrowly escapes an assassination attempt at his home.Suspecting that Hyman Roth was behind the assassination attempt, Michael meets with Pentangeli and asks him to help take his revenge. Pentangeli agrees, promising to end his feud with the Rosato brothers and giving the impression that Michael supported their claim, so as to give Roth the impression that Michael did not know he was conspiring against him.Back in New York, Pentangeli arranges a meeting with the Rosato brothers. At the meeting, Tony Rosato (played by Danny Aiello) ambushes Pentangeli with a garotte, telling him, \"Michael Corleone says hello.\" A policeman passes by and the murder attempt devolves into a shootout in the street. Pentangeli disappears and is believed to be dead.Although Rosato invokes Michael's name in the attempted hit on Pentangeli it is clear from dialogue between Michael and Fredo that Pentangeli's fate after the shootout was a mystery to Michael. This discussion happens in the brothers' first meeting following Michael's confrontation with Fredo in Havana.Later, at a Congressional hearing, Pentangeli is presented as a surprise witness by the committee. He has been in the custody of the FBI since the murder attempt, believing that Michael ordered him killed. He is prepared to testify that Michael is the head of the most powerful Mafia family in the nation and has ordered countless murders. He is considered very credible, since as a capo there is no insulation between him and Michael. Pentangeli also intends to testify that Michael personally murdered Captain McCluskey and Virgil Solozzo (in The Godfather). Because Pentangeli's protective custody is so secure, Michael knows he will be unable to have him killed before the trial. Instead, he flies Pentangeli's brother, Vincenzo, in from Sicily, who appears in the hearing room. Upon seeing his brother, Pentangeli then recants his earlier statements, and now claims that the Corleone family is innocent of any wrongdoing, thereby derailing the government's case.After the hearing, Tom Hagen visits Pentangeli. Pentangeli discusses how tough his brother is, much tougher than himself, says Frankie. Hagen tells Frankie that he did the right thing by recanting, and that if he accepts responsibility for turning on the Corleone family, Frankie's own family will always be taken care of and remain unharmed. He thanks Hagen, returns to his room, and slits his wrists in the bathtub.The finished film leaves unclear exactly what about his brother's presence caused Frankie to change his story. An early version of the script, however, details that Frankie's brother is himself a hardened Mafia chieftain in Sicily. Shocked that Frankie is about to betray the Corleones, his brother appears to remind Frankie that he must not break the Mafia's code of silence, Omert\u00e0. His brother's mere presence and icy stare directed at Frankie serve as a threat that if Frankie follows through with his planned testimony, retribution will be taken against his former mistress and their child, who are living in Sicily under his brother's guardianship.Original plans called for Clemenza to return for Part II. However, Richard Castellano, the actor who portrayed Clemenza in The Godfather, agreed to return only on the condition that his girlfriend at the time be allowed to rewrite his dialogue to his own satisfaction. Rather than give in to this demand, director Francis Ford Coppola rewrote the script so that Clemenza had recently died of a heart attack. Pentangeli was created to be Clemenza's successor. Pentangeli first appears wearing a black band in remembrance of Clemenza, which is how his death is explained to the audience.","Pat Geary is a fictional character portrayed by G.D. Spradlin in the film The Godfather, Part II. He is a corrupt Democratic U.S. senator from Nevada. Some have suggested that the character is based on Patrick A. McCarran, who represented Nevada in the U.S. Senate from 1933 to 1954. Nevada's two U.S. Senators at the time of The Godfather, Part II were Alan H. Bible (D-NV), and Howard W. Cannon (D-NV). Bible, Cannon, and Nevada Governor Grant Sawyer were friendly with the Teamsters in Las Vegas, William F. Harrah, Harvey Gross, The Smith Family of Reno's Harold's Club, Howard Hughes, and brothel owner Joe Conforte.At the beginning of the film, set in 1958, Geary and his wife (played by Patricia Kilbourn Walton) attend the First Communion party of the son of Michael Corleone, the head of the Corleone crime family, who has moved his base of operations to Nevada in order to begin easing his way out of crime. Geary publicly accepts a contribution in the name of Vito Corleone intended as a donation for the local public university. While speaking before the large gathering, Geary slaughters the pronunciation of Vito's name, saying VI-TOE [va to k li 'n] and the last name Corleone (to rhyme with \"Right, Ho, for Dion\"), and misnames Michael Corleone's wife Kay as Pat.After the public ceremony, Geary meets with Michael in his office. The Corleone family had obtained control of several casinos in Nevada. However, with respect to one of the casinos, Corleone was having trouble obtaining a gambling license from the state authorities. Geary offers to help Michael obtain the license in exchange for an exorbitant bribe ($250,000 up front, and 4% of the gross monthly revenues from all Corleone casinos). Michael asks Geary why he should pay so much money when the license fee is only $20,000.At that point, Geary launches into a vindictive attack on Michael, the Corleone family, and Italian-Americans in general, calling them \"oily-haired\" and \"dirty.\" He says that he despises Michael and all he stands for and that he \"intend[s] to squeeze\" the Corleone family for all he can get. He also demonstrates that he is capable of pronouncing the \"Corleone\" name reasonably well in the Italian manner, even adding a trill to the R ([kor li 'o ne]), in contrast with his previous public performance. He gives Michael a day to respond to his offer.As Geary heads for the door, Michael offers his response: Geary will obtain the gambling license for the Corleones for free, with no bribe. Indeed, Michael expects Geary to pay the $20,000 licensing fee out of his own pocket. Geary laughs and leaves, referring to Michael as \"Mr. Core-lee-own-E.\"Some time later, Geary spends the night with a prostitute in a brothel run by Fredo, Michael's brother. Having suffered from an alcoholic blackout, he awakes in a bed covered in blood next to the woman, who is dead. The dead prostitute's wrists are handcuffed; her legs spread wide. Geary has no memory of what happened, and is frantic with horror and worry. Tom Hagen arrives on the scene and promises Geary that since the woman has no family, the matter can be safely covered up. It is implied that the Corleones have engineered this situation, perhaps through drugging the senator. Michael's capo Al Neri is seen in the bathroom wiping his hands with a towel, indicating that it was he that murdered the prostitute.Subsequently, it appears that the Corleones' \"help\" with the incident (in other words, their blackmail of the senator) sways Geary to the family's side. When Michael goes to Havana to meet with Hyman Roth and other crime bosses, Geary is in the group, greets Michael warmly, and accompanies them to a live sex show.Later in the movie, when a U.S. Senate committee is investigating organized crime and subpoenas Michael and others to answer to charges of criminal activity, Geary speaks in defense of Italian-Americans, deploring the stereotyping of them as criminals.","Albert \"Al\" Neri is a fictional character appearing in Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather and the three films based on it. He is portrayed by actor Richard Bright. In the Godfather game, he is voiced by Gary Chalk. He functions as the personal bodyguard, caporegime and chief assassin to Michael Corleone. He is completely devoid of fear and completely loyal to Michael Corleone.In the novel The Godfather, Neri began his career as a New York City policeman where he earned a reputation as a legitimately tough officer thanks to his fierce temper, quick reflexes, and tremendous physical strength. He frequently patrolled with a large flashlight which he used to great effect, either cracking the foreheads of Italian youths that ran with street gangs or shattering the windshields of diplomats who showed no regard for traffic laws. After his wife left him in fear of his temper, he killed a drug dealer and pimp by shattering his skull with the flashlight, and was convicted of manslaughter. Tom Hagen and Pete Clemenza saw in his record a parallel to Luca Brasi, Vito Corleone's previous enforcer, and arranged for his release from prison. Michael, appealing to Neri's sense of loyalty and Sicilian roots, recruited him into Clemenza's regime where he \"made his bones\" and became Michael's chief lieutenant. Tom Hagen once said to Michael following the completion of Neri's training, \"Well, now you've got your Luca.\"When Michael ordered the assassination of the heads of the five New York Families, at the end of The Godfather Part I, Neri was responsible for the murder of Emilio Barzini, donning his old police uniform in order to arrange an ambush on the courthouse steps as Barzini was leaving. After Salvatore Tessio is killed for attempting to betray Michael, Neri takes over as caporegime of Tessio's former regime. When Michael and his family moved to Nevada, Neri became head of security for all hotels controlled by the Corleones.In The Godfather Part II, Neri is seen to be an unofficial second-in-command to Michael, and serves as one of Michael's capos along with Rocco Lampone and Frank Pentangeli. He is responsible for a prostitute's murder that guarantees the loyalty of Senator Pat Geary. Neri was also personally responsible for the assassination of Michael's brother Fredo Corleone, under Michael's orders for Fredo's previous betrayal.This is demonstrated further in the novel The Godfather's Revenge, where he takes part in an attempt to kidnap Nick Geraci's father (which fails). He is seriously wounded in the final shootout at the end of the novel.By the time of The Godfather Part III, the aging assassin was still working for the Corleones, his loyalty to Michael extending to the new Don, Michael's nephew Vincent. His talents were called upon once again at the conclusion of the film when Vincent ordered him to kill Archbishop Gilday in revenge for the priest's intrigue against the family.","Peter Clemenza (1890 - 1958) is a fictional character appearing in Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather and two of the three films based on it.In his young adulthood, in The Godfather Part II, Clemenza is portrayed by Bruno Kirby. In his later years, he is portrayed by Richard S. Castellano.Peter Clemenza is one of two (later three) caporegimes in the Corleone Family (the other being Salvatore Tessio). He rules over the family's territory in The Bronx. Although he is less intelligent than his friend and counterpart Tessio, he is said to be more brutal and direct in the book. In the film, he may be perceived at first as a fat, dim witted thug, but later on he is shown to be a formidable assassin.Clemenza became a friend of Vito Corleone after immigrating from Sicily, when Corleone held a package of guns for him to prevent their discovery by the police. Although he is a native of Italy, and in The Godfather II is shown speaking perfect colloquial Italian as a young man in his 20s, in The Godfather an older Clemenza speaks with a highly pronounced New York\/Brooklyn accent. One of the few remaining hints of his Italian roots is that he pronounces \"Corleone\" as \"Cor-yon-nay.\"A friendly and jovial man, he was known as a storyteller among many of his acquaintances and family members - a trait that endeared him to Vito Corleone, whom Puzo described as \"a listener to storytellers.\" Clemenza got his start selling stolen goods such as dresses and guns with Vito and Tessio as far back as 1917 and became a key figure in the growing Corleone family.Vito kept him close through the years. For instance, Vito makes Clemenza godfather to his oldest son Sonny, and handled Sonny's training once Sonny decided to join his father's family. However, this was to control his brutal and more ambitious tendencies (even though he had mellowed somewhat in a decade of peace between the families).Clemenza plays a key role in aiding Michael following the shooting of Vito. He retrains Michael how to fire a gun, walking him through the scenario for assassinating Virgil Sollozzo, and gets someone to plant the gun prior to the assassination. In the wave of killings that cements Michael's power, Clemenza garroted Carlo Rizzi for his role in setting up Sonny for assassination. During the murders of the heads of the Five Families in the film, Clemenza personally shot Don Stracci and his bodyguard. It is Clemenza's greeting of Michael as \"Don Michael\" at the end of the book (as \"Don Corleone\" at the end of the film) that convinces Kay Adams-Corleone that her husband has become as ruthless as his father.Clemenza's forces include soldiers Paulie Gatto, Willi Cicci, Al Neri, Rocco Lampone and Aldo Trapani. He handled many of his men closely, proud of picking Lampone as a caporegime and locating Neri as a successor to Luca Brasi. He could also be cruel with them - when he found out that Gatto had been collaborating with Sollozo, he saw it as a personal betrayal and orchestrated the execution personally, with Rocco pulling the trigger.Ironically, clemenza literally means \"mercy\" or \"forgiveness\" in Italian. The English cognate is clemency.In Mark Winegardner's novel The Godfather Returns, Clemenza stands in as consigliere at Commission meetings during the course of the book (since Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere and he is also not Sicilian, so hecannot be involved in these meetings.) He died of a heart attack shortly before 1958, a consequence of his excessive lifestyle - an autopsy revealed his heart was \"twice the size of a normal man's.\" In the film The Godfather: Part II, Willie Cicci, appears to deny this, stating \"that was no heart attack\" but no further info is given. Pete Clemenza was succeeded as caporegime by Frank Pentangeli.In Puzo's novel The Sicilian, Clemenza is featured in Sicily, where he meets Michael Corleone in order to arrange his safe return to America and also to oversee the safe passage of the novel's lead character, Salvatore Guiliano. In this novel he has an older brother, Domenic Clemenza, who is an old-fashioned and well respected Mafia Don. Neither Clemenza nor Michael Corleone are featured in the film version of the novel, presumably because of copyright restrictions on the Godfather film franchise.Clemenza was originally supposed to return in The Godfather Part II. However, Castellano demanded that he write all of Clemenza's lines himself, along with a large salary increase.[citation needed] Director Francis Ford Coppola refused and had Clemenza killed instead, replacing him with Frank Pentangeli.Richard S. Castellano and Bruno Kirby appeared together in a television series entitled The Super, in which they played a father and son.","Born: 1897\nDied: 1959 (stroke)Spouse: Don Vito Corleone (1891-1955)Kids: Santino Corleone (1916-1948)\nFredo Corleone (1919-1959)\nMichael Corleone (1920-1997)\nConnie Corleone (1923-)\nTom Hagen (1910-1964) (adopted)Carmella Corleone was born in Sicily, Italy in 1897. She came to America with her family in 1910. After leaving Ellis Island, she lived in Little Italy, New York City, New York. There she meant Vito Corleone and they married 1913. He worked at an olive oil shop in Little Italy. In 1914, they had their first child Santino. In 1917, they had their second Fredo. Michael followed in 1920 and Connie in 1922. They also adopted Tom Hagen in 1924. In the early 1920s, Vito was fired from his job and started to rob people with good friends Peter Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio. They eventually started their own mafia family in 1925. During an on-going war during the late 1940s with a rival family, her son Santino was killed resulting in the end of the war.

Jackson) when he is ordered to kill someone.Vincent is an \"Elvis man\": He wears a bola tie with his suit, he has long hair pulled back into a ponytail, and he orders his Douglas Sirk Steak \"bloody as hell.\" Despite being a hitman, Vincent shows some signs of humanity, such as scrupulous loyalty and a general concern for the few people he cares about. He is also a heroin user. He resides in Redondo Beach, as he mentions to Winston Wolfe when Wolf offers him a ride home.He is the brother of Reservoir Dogs-character Vic Vega, played by Michael Madsen.","Whether he was working for gang boss Marsellus Wallace or not, for years one thing that gangster Jules Winnfield openly recited was a version of the Biblical chapter Ezekiel 25:17 to his victims before he killed them. One day, a job for Wallace goes awry when his employees Winnfield and Vincent Vega go to recover a briefcase that was stolen from Wallace. Winnfield and Vega dispatch Wallace's ex-partners with gunplay and ease. When their work seems complete, an extra man who was hiding in a spare room in the apartment attacks the hitmen by surprise, shooting at them with his .357 handgun. None of the extra man's shots hit their targets. Jules and Vincent shoot the extra man dead.While Vincent chalks the incident up to luck, Jules's reaction is different, as he argues that God stopped the bullets. Jules and Vincent leave, carrying the briefcase and taking with them a fourth man, Marvin. In their moving car, while the hitmen discuss what exactly happened in their favor, Vincent accidentally shoots Marvin in the face. The resulting explosion covers the hitmen and their car's interior in blood and guts. Jules and Vincent narrowly get out of trouble with help from Jules's buddy Jimmie Dimmick, and an acquaintance of Marsellus's, Winston Wolf.Jules and Vincent take a breather at a restaurant where they eat breakfast and get into it again over Jules' recollection of \"divine intervention.\" Then, the coffee shop is hijacked by a pair of armed robbers by the names of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny. With guile, Jules gets the upper hand over the robbers. He lets Pumpkin and Honey Bunny leave with a large sum of money that they took from the diners. Jules restates his Biblical quotation to them, saying he feels that he is \"the tyranny of evil men,\" but he is trying \"to be a shepherd.\" Jules and Vince walk out with Marsellus's precious briefcase, which they return to him.

You dig.\"Tuco, in \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" (1966) was \"the Ugly\" - a wanted man in the American Old West, with a price on his head of $2,000. This Mexican desperado's wanted poster is not completely unfurled by the gang ambushing him at the beginning of the film, so we cannot be sure for all of what he was wanted (at least by them).However, a partial account of Tuco's other known crimes is transcribed below as best known discerned from the dialog of the court officials during a careful viewing of the classic film \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" in which he is just about to be hanged (twice); only to be \"rescued\" by 'The Man with No Name'* (called \"Blondie\" by Tuco) using his miraculous movies-only possible sharpshooting with a Henry repeating rifle (which also miraculously fires in terrific rapid-fire to affect the 'redemption' of Tuco):Tuco's Crimes Stated During the First \"Hanging\":\nTuco was \"wanted in 14 counties of this state, the condemned is found guilty of the crimes of murder; armed robbery of citizens, state banks and post offices; the theft of sacred objects; arson in a state prison; perjury; bigamy; deserting his wife and children; inciting prostitution; kidnapping; extortion; receiving stolen goods; selling stolen goods; passing counterfeit money; and contrary to the laws of this state the condemned is guilty of using marked cards ... (inaudible due to other dialog) ... Therefore, according to the powers vested in us we sentence the accused here before us Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez and any other aliases he might have to hang by the neck until dead. May God have mercy on his soul. Proceed.\"(\"Blondie\" starts delivering his miracle shots cutting the rope, dusting off the hats of the official and lookers-on, etc.)The Second \"Hanging\":\nTuco was also \"wanted in 15 counties of this state, the condemned standing before us - sitting before us - Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez has been for guilty by the Third District Circuit Court of the following crimes: murder; assaulting a Justice of the Peace; raping a virgin of the White race, and statuatory rape of a minor of the Black race; of derailing of trains in order to rob the passengers; ...

Of all these crimes the accused made made a full, spontaneous confession. Therefore we condemn him to be hung (sic) by the neck until dead. May the Lord have mercy on his soul. Proceed.\"(The shooting starts again, and Tuco is one again 'redeemed', but since \"it's getting harder\", \"Blondie\" dissolves the partnership (it's \"untied\"). He rides off with the money and generously - albeit smart-assedly - tells Tuco that \"you remain tied\" and \"can keep the rope\".)The two re-form their 'partnership' to battle \"Angel Eyes\" (\"Sentenza\" as masterfully played by Lee van Cleef) and have memorable good times tracking down the $200,000 in gold - Sentenza ('The Bad') being not allowed to partake, naturally.Exactly why \"Blondie\" doesn't dispatch Tuco and divide the loot with him at the end of the movie for his evidently nefarious life of crime is unknown (except, of course, because \"Blondie\" is 'The Good'), yet we, the audience liken to the hapless Tuco and invest a passing interest in his well-being, general health and good spirits. And even though \"Blondie\" executes three possibly obstensively innocent men (the 3 bounty hunters) just to get him for himself for the hanging\/rope cutting partnership, We get to like 'the Rat' at least enough to not want to see him killed, even at the famous and story-tidy - yet marvelously high-tension - \"Last Hanging of Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez\" at the end of the film.(And it's made obvious to Tuco that anybody as capable as \"Blondie\" would not appreciate being followed to obscond with his 'cut' of the take.)* In \"For a Fist Full of Dollars\" Clint Eastwood's character is referred to as 'Manco' by a sheriff, but since each trilogy is considered as a separate story with different characters, we never know his real name in the film.","\"The man with no name\" is a mysterious man who travels the country on his mule. He wears a signature poncho and hat, always smokes cigars, and always carries a .45 with a snake on the handle.He becomes involved directly with the conflict in San Miguel between the Rojos and the Baxters, turning them against eachother.He releases a woman, Marisol, that the Rojo's had kept as a hostage. Marisol and her family are able to flee as a result of Joe's actions. He eventually kills off the Rojos after they've killed the Baxters, ending the dispute.He has also worked at a bounty killer, making a living by catching outlaws and turning them into the law. On one such occasion, he was pursuing an outlaw known as El Indio. In order to catch him, he formed a partnership with another gunslinger named Colonel Mortimer. The two of them became good friends, and after an intense gunfight, Mortimer decided to allow the man to take the bodies of Indio and his gang and take the entire reward himself.He also briefly attempted to take advantage of a bounty that was placed on a bandit named Tuco. They arranged for him to be turned in so the reward could be collected. Tuco would then be freed by the man and the reward would be split between them. However, this did not go well after the two began double-crossing each other.Very little is known about his background, although sometimes he reveals something. In a conversation with the Alcoholic Union Captain, he claims he hails from Illinois. And when Marisol asked why he released her, her husband and their child and gave them his money, he replied: \"Why? I knew someone like you once and there was no-one there to help.\"His plans for the future are revealed to Col. Douglas Mortimer. He says he wants to last much longer than 50 years of age (the age Mortimer has almost reached). \"When I get my hands on Indio and that $10,000, I'm gonna buy myself a little place. Possibly retire.\" From these words one can conclude that his goal is to get rich and when he succeeds his life as a drifter will be over.Apparently he prefers not to reveal his name. As a result he has gone under a number of nicknames. He was known to some by the nickname Blondie. He has also at least once been referred to as Joe simply because it is a common name. He has gone under the name Monco, but it is unknown if this is his real last name, if it is another nickname or if it is simply a pseudonym he has used.There has been debate wheither Joe, Monco and Blondie are in fact the same person...","The Bad, a ruthless, unfeeling and sociopathic mercenary named \"Angel Eyes\" (Sentenza - Sentence - in the original script and the Italian version), who always finishes a job he's paid for (which is usually finding...and killing people).

He is also the secret identity of the crime-fighting Vigilante known as the Batman.Bruce Wayne was raised in the fictional city of Gotham where has parents owned Wayne Enterprises, employing some 170,000 people. When Bruce was a young boy he witnessed the tragic murder of his parents, by the criminal Joe Chill, late one night after leaving a theater (where the movie \"Zorro\" was playing). He was put in the custody of the Wayne family butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Bruce grew up enraged and traumatized by his parents death. Years later when Wayne was in his early 20's, he took to crime fighting as a way to deal with his anger, as well as avenge his parents. One evening whilst brooding over his inability to intimidate criminals, a bat came flying through the window of his study at stately Wayne Manor. This event sparked the idea of donning a frightening bat-like costume. The concept of a bat-themed suit resonated with Bruce due to his childhood fear of bats and the memory of his father wearing a bat costume to a masquerade party.Bruce Wayne has appeared as Batman in comic books, graphic novels, novels. cartoon series, television series, animated films, and feature films since his creation in 1939 by cartoonists Bob Kane and Bill Finger.","Appearing to be the most evil, deranged, and flat out psychotic killer of all comic book villains, The Joker is the primary antagonist of Batman. He is the complete opposite of Batman, in everything from appearance (Batman tends to be a rather large and muscular man, while The Joker is typically a man of average height or even taller possessing a skinny frame), to ideals. The Joker views murder as sport, and will not hesitate to toy with his food before he eats it, even if said food are the men he has hired to work for him. As intimidating as he is psychotic, he still manages to recruit hordes of henchmen despite his maniacal insanity.The Joker's physical appearance is a polar opposite of that of Batman. Batman uses dark colors such as gray and black to intimidate criminals, while The Joker relies on bright colors, such as purple, green, and sometimes orange to do his bidding. The Joker also has a melted cliche clown face, the origins of which differ depending on the continuity he is used in. Some incarnations of The Joker see him wearing actual make up (such as in the film \"The Dark Knight\"), while others show his skin actually having been bleached (as in the 1989 \"Batman\"). He also traditionally has green hair and red lips, to complete the look of the psycho clown.His methods are unpredictable and incalculable. He does things according to his own twisted sense of logic, and does not desire money. If there was one thing that he did desire, it would be the power to instill anarchy into Gotham by any means necessary, proving that organization is meaningless and futile. He is an exceptionally intelligent man, and this tends to be his greatest weapon against Batman, the police, and the District Attorney's office. He is often confronted by the authorities, but easily evades capture due to sick and twisted mind games he plays on them, all full of mystery. While Batman prefers to stay in the shadows, The Joker basks in the spotlight, often broadcasting himself to the public and media outlets.Though he may be Batman's undisputed arch-nemesis, The Joker has always held some kind of respect for Batman, saying in \"The Dark Knight\", \"Why would I kill you? What would I do without you?\". He also acknowledges that Batman will never kill him, as that is Batman's only rule, and since The Joker will not kill Batman, they are truly destined to fight forever. As The Joker says, \"This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.\"Throughout the course of The Joker's involvement in Batman's film and television appearances, he has had many different and diverse interpretations. In the 1960's, Cesar Romero portrayed the character as a campy, funny, strangely psychotic, yet harmless killer. In 1989, Jack Nicholson played The Joker in a somewhat human way and fashionable to the comics, however upped the \"killer\" aspect of the character, as well as the quick temper. He also possessed bleached skin in the film, and received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance. In the early to mid 1990's, Mark Hamill voiced the character as icy cold and cruel, vastly different from Nicholson's character interpretation.In 2008, however, The Joker was taken in a direction he had never been taken before. In \"The Dark Knight\", the late Heath Ledger portrayed The Joker as a completely psychotic and demonic killer, a sort of Nietzschean superman, with no moral attachment towards anybody but sees Batman as true value to himself. Any humor that the character shows is sardonic and cruel. Ledger's Joker was a personification of disregard and chaos. His primary goal seems to be to prove that people, in dire situations, are just as sick and horrible as he is. This Joker's most frightening and dangerous asset is his intelligence. Ledger was honored with a posthumous an Academy Award, a BAFTA and a Golden Globe Award for his performance.In all his shapes and forms, The Joker remains as one of the scariest and most ingenious of all comic book villain history.One of his proudest achievements was turning the well-respected psychiatrist Dr. Harleen Quinzel into his criminal sidekick and 'girlfriend' Harley Quinn. She is madly in love with him; whether or not he returns her feelings is a constant discussion of debate among fans.","Once a high-profile District Attorney for Gotham City, Harvey Dent was horribly disfigured by an attack made during the indictment hearing of crime boss Sal \"The Boss\" Maroni. After confronting Maroni with evidence linking him to the murder of a small-time bookie -- most notably Maroni's lucky double-headed coin, which he had accidentally left behind at the scene of the crime -- an enraged Maroni threw a vial of sulphuric acid into his face, burning the left side while leaving the right half of his face untouched.Miraculously, Dent survived this attack but still bore the acid scars on the left side of his face. Driven insane by his traumatic experience, Dent developed a seperate, more violent personality known as Two-Face, which drove him to embark on a life of crime.Two-Face is obsessed with duality, and almost all of his crimes are based around the number two. A notable quirk of his is his dependance on the use of Maroni's double-headed coin, one side of which he has marred with a knife to reflect his own conflicted personality. The result of a coin toss can be a matter of life or death to his victims, as he uses the coin to determine whether he will perform an act of good or evil in a given situation.However, in the new film The Dark Knight, Harvey Dent suffers the injury when he and his fiance Rachel, Bruce Wayne's love, are both being held captive by Maroni in seperate locations surrounded by oil barrels and two bombs set to simultaneously explode in each location. Dent, in an attempt to break free falls over in his chair and knocks over an oil barrel covering one side of his face in petrol. The Joker tells Batman the location of the two and says he must choose which one lives, Batman decides to save Rachel but the Joker lied about who was where so he actuallly saves Dent. Once Dent and Batman are outside, the building explodes and one side of Dent's face catches fire hence \"Two-Face\". Dent resents Batman because he saved him rather than Rachel. Also the double headed coin is his to begin and he uses it to show that he makes his own luck i.e.(Heads I win, Tails you win) and the coin is burnt in the explosion on one side rather than defaced by a knife but it is used in a similar manner.","Alfred Pennyworth is the faithful butler to multi-billionaire Bruce Wayne aka The Batman. Created by artist Bob Kane and writer Jerry Robinson, Alfred made his first appearance in Batman #16 in May 1943. He originally was a retired actor and intelligence agent who carried out his father's deathbed wish to continue serving the Wayne family as their butler. Alfred, almost by accident, discovered that his masters, Bruce Wayne and his ward, Dick Grayson, were the true identities of The Batman and Robin and so became their confidant.Later in DC history - after the \"Crisis On Infinite Earth\" saga - it was established that Alfred had been the Wayne family's butler all of Bruce's life. It was he who virtually raised the young Wayne and helped him to establish himself as The Batman.","Batman Begins (2005)Rachel is Bruce Wayne's closest childhood friend. Rachel's mother worked as a domestic servant at Wayne Manor, and the two would often play together on the grounds. After Bruce's parents are murdered by Joe Chill, Rachel's mother seeks other employment and leaves Wayne Manor with Rachel.Rachel enrolls in law school and gets an internship at the Gotham City District Attorney's office during her first year. After Chill is murdered for testifying against Mafia boss Carmine Falcone, Bruce reveals to Rachel that he intended to murder Chill himself, and is angry that Falcone had him killed, depriving him of his chance for revenge. Rachel is horrified, and tells Bruce that his late parents would be ashamed of him. She then takes Bruce down to the slums and shows him that Falcone's criminal empire has worsened the poverty created by Gotham City's economic depression, and states that every day more people just like Joe Chill turn to crime out of desperation. Soon afterward, Bruce leaves the United States and Rachel continues her studies in law school. Years later, she becomes an Assistant District Attorney. Her boss, District Attorney Carl Finch, is later murdered by Ra's al Ghul's henchmen.Rachel dedicates her career to eliminating crime in Gotham City, in the process making enemies of Falcone and later Dr. Jonathan Crane, Arkham Asylum's corrupt chief psychiatrist. Falcone eventually sends two thugs to kill her, but she is rescued by Gotham City's mysterious vigilante, Batman. Around the same time, Bruce returns to Gotham. Rachel is surprised that he did not contact her, and later feels disappointed in Bruce, taking his playboy fa\u00e7ade at face value.Later, Crane drugs her with his fear toxin at Arkham while she is evaluating Falcone, who has suffered a psychotic breakdown from the hallucinogen. Batman rescues her again, administers an antidote and tells her that Crane is working with the League of Shadows, a terrorist organization led by Ra's al Ghul. He then gives her instructions for a plan to save the city from the League's attack, after which he sedates her and has his butler, Alfred Pennyworth, return her home. She wakes up in her bed, remembers Batman's instructions immediately, and delivers samples of an anti-toxin to Batman's ally, Gotham City Police Department sergeant James Gordon.The League starts a riot in one of Gotham City's slums, and Rachel is trapped. Crane, who has now assumed the criminal alter ego of \"The Scarecrow\", attacks her again. She defends herself and a boy caught in the riot by firing a taser at Crane's face, driving him away. Soon, the city is overrun by Arkham's inmates, whom the League has released, and Rachel and the boy are surrounded by lunatics led by Falcone's henchman, Victor Zsasz. Batman saves them at the last minute and gives Rachel a hint as to his secret identity. As Rachel realizes that her childhood sweetheart is also her masked savior, he leaves to save the remaining innocent bystanders and defeat Ra's in battle.Towards the end of the film, Rachel visits the remains of Wayne Manor, finding Bruce and Alfred sorting through the wreckage. She and Bruce share a kiss, but she tells him that they cannot be together until Gotham no longer needs Batman. At the end of the movie's novelization, she is named interim District Attorney.The Dark Knight (2008)By the start of the film, Rachel is in a relationship with newly elected District Attorney Harvey Dent, creating a conflict between him, herself, and Bruce Wayne. Dent soon asks Rachel to marry him, but she does not have a clear answer, being torn between her love for both men.At one point, the Joker confronts Rachel at Dent's fundraiser, holding her at knifepoint. Batman arrives and fights off the men, but the Joker grabs Rachel and throws her from the skyscraper window. Batman, without thinking twice, jumps out the window after her, breaking their fall on a car below.Rachel is next seen at the funeral of police commissioner Gillian Loeb, who was murdered by the Joker. Masquerading as a police honor guard, the Joker attempts to assassinate the mayor but fails when Gordon puts himself in the line of fire. One of the Joker's henchmen is quickly caught; Dent goes into a fit of rage upon seeing a tag with Rachel's name on his shirt, marking her as the next victim. Dent promptly threatens to kill the man, at which point the Batman intervenes. Rachel then takes shelter in Bruce's penthouse at Dent's insistence. There she and Bruce briefly rekindle their romance. He admits that he desires to turn himself in as Batman and hopes they could eventually be together, to which Rachel says that she meant what she said about waiting for him. He leaves for Dent's press conference, where he sees Dent claim to be Batman and take Bruce's fall. Rachel is disgusted, and gives Alfred an unsealed letter to be delivered to Bruce \"when the time is right.\" She promptly leaves the penthouse.After Batman and Gordon capture the Joker, Rachel and Dent are kidnapped by corrupt Gotham City police officers working under crime lord Sal Maroni's payroll. Batman interrogates the Joker and soon learns that the lives of both Dent and Rachel are at stake. The Joker tells Batman that he must choose which one of them to save and gives him both locations. However, the Joker has switched the addresses, with the intention of orchestrating Dent's downfall. Batman speeds off, believing that he is traveling to Rachel's destination. Both Rachel and Dent are tied up in rooms surrounded with gasoline drums and a phone-bomb, allowing them to talk to one another. Rachel tells Harvey that she accepts his proposal and wants to marry him. Batman arrives at Dent's location (thinking it's Rachel's as Joker mixed up the locations) in time to save him, but Gordon arrives at the other location too late, and Rachel is killed in the explosion.In a note written for Bruce that Rachel leaves with Alfred hours before the kidnapping, she reveals that while she cares for both Bruce and Dent, she says she has chosen Dent because she loves him and wishes to marry him, and knows now for sure Bruce will not be able to give up being Batman. She says she can only love Bruce now as a friend and says not to give up faith in people.Alfred is about to give the note to Bruce after her death but, upon hearing Bruce ponder that his only solace is the knowledge that she would have waited for him, he decides to burn the note instead, deciding that sometimes, it is better for people to keep their faith than be disappointed by the truth.","James \"Jim\" Worthington Gordon is a supporting character in DC Comics' Batman series. Created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane, he first appeared in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939). He was the first Batman supporting character to be introduced.In most incarnations of the Batman mythos, Gordon is the police commissioner of Batman's home of Gotham City. He shares the heros deep commitment of ridding the dark and corrupting city of crime. In Golden and Silver age comics and on the 1960s Batman television show, Gordon fully trusts, and is even somewhat dependent on Batman. In most modern stories, he is somewhat skeptical of Batman's vigilante method but recognizes the necessity of Batman and the two have a mutual respect and tacit friendship. He was the husband of Barbara Kean Gordon and Sarah Essen Gordon. Gordon is also the father or adopted father, depending on the continuity, of Barbara Gordon, the original Batgirl and later Oracle, and James Gordon, Jr..Gordon is an important part of the Batman mythos and has appeared in most other media adaptations of the character.Early characterizationsIn most versions of the Batman mythos, he is at one point or another depicted as Gotham City's police commissioner. He succeeded Commissioner Grogan in the rank at GCPD. Gordon frequently contacts Batman for help in solving various crimes, particularly those committed by supervillains. Because DC Comics retconned its characters' history in the 1985 miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths, and because of different interpretations in television and film, the details of Gordon's history vary from story to story.In the original pre-Crisis version of his history, Gordon was a police detective who initially bitterly resented the mysterious vigilante's interference in police business. Although the Batman seemed to fight on the side of justice, his methods and phenomenal track record for stopping crimes and capturing criminals embarrassed the police by comparison. Eventually, Batman met up with Gordon and persuaded the detective that they needed each other's help. Batman was deputized and worked with Gordon as an agent of the law.Post-CrisisBatman: Year OneThe post-Crisis version of the character was introduced in the mid-1980s storyline Batman: Year One, written by Frank Miller. In this version, Gordon was transferred back to the city after spending more than fifteen years in Chicago. A man of integrity, Gordon found that his only ally against the mob-controlled administration was the Batman. One of the most significant differences in this version is that Batman was never deputized and Gordon's relationship with him was kept out of the public eye whenever possible. It was also added that he was a Special Forces veteran who was more than capable of hand to hand combat.When Gordon needs to summon Batman, he uses the Bat-Signal, a specially modified Klieg searchlight with a stylized symbol of a bat placed on it so that it projects a large emblem shaped in Batman's bat insignia on the sky or buildings of Gotham City. Batman often disappears silently when Gordon's back is turned, often while Gordon is in the middle of a rant about legal red tape.The miniseries Gordon of Gotham takes place about nearly twenty years prior to the current events of the DC Universe and ten years before coming to Gotham in Batman: Year One. It reveals that Gordon, during his tenure in Chicago, struggled with his wife over conceiving a child while taking university night classes in criminology. He faces brutality among other officers after uncovering corruption within the force. Later, Gordon uncovers evidence of rigging the mayoral election and brings down two of his fellow officers, which leads to his commissioner recommending to him that he transfer to Gotham quickly.Batman: The Killing JokeIn the 1988 graphic novel The Killing Joke, the Joker kidnaps Gordon after shooting and paralyzing Barbara. He then cages Gordon in the freak show of an abandoned amusement park and forces him to look at enlarged photos of his wounded daughter naked in an effort to drive him insane, thus proving to Batman that even the most grounded, seemingly normal people can lose their minds after having \"a very bad day.\" Batman eventually apprehends the Joker and rescues Gordon. Despite the intense trauma he has endured, Gordon's sanity and code of ethics is intact; he insists that Batman apprehend the Joker without harming him in order to \"show him that our way works.\"No Man's LandThe No Man's Land storyline took place after Gotham was destroyed by an earthquake and isolated from outside assistance. Inside Gotham, Gordon struggled to maintain order amidst rampant crime. Batman was mysteriously absent for the initial three months, and Gordon felt somewhat betrayed. He forged an uneasy alliance with Two-Face but was later double-crossed, kidnapped, and put on trial by Two-Face for breaking their \"legally-binding\" alliance. He escaped punishment, and later met with Batman once again. In this confrontation, Gordon expressed his disgust towards Batman for letting Gotham \"fall into ruin\". Batman offered to prove his trust by revealing his secret identity, but Gordon refused to look when Batman removed his mask. Eventually their relationship was repaired.The death of Sarah EssenGordon fell in love with and married fellow officer Sarah Essen. However, Essen could not comprehend why Gordon needed Batman so much, which occasionally put a strain on their relationship. Unfortunately, she was fatally shot by the Joker at the end of the No Man's Land storyline. An enraged Gordon wanted to kill Joker, but instead was persuaded to shoot him in the leg, in revenge for Joker's shot which had paralyzed Gordon's daughter. Not long after this, Gordon was gunned down by a crook seeking revenge for a previous arrest. Though seriously injured, he eventually pulled througRetirementGordon retired from the police force after having served more than 20 years in it. He remained in Gotham, and occasionally enjoyed nighttime visits from Batman who came to him for company and advice. Commissioner Michael Akins has taken his position.After Barbara required surgery to save her life from the Brainiac virus, Gordon visited his adoptive daughter in Metropolis. She revealed to him her current role as Oracle, as well as her past as Batgirl. Gordon admitted that he knew of her life as Batgirl, but was pleasantly surprised to know of her career as the computer information broker of the heroes. He is very proud of her accomplishments.ReturnAs part of DC's \"One Year Later\" Gordon has returned to the role of Commissioner; as of the year-long jump he has been back in the job for 3 months. The circumstances behind this are currently unknown, though there have been allusions to extreme corruption within the GCPD. These allusions are supported by events within Gotham Central, especially involving Detective Jim Corrigan. Most recently, Gordon survived an attempt on his life by the Joker (Batman #655), who had drugged him with Joker Venom in an attack on the GCPD. He was taken to the hospital in time.Gordon and Batman's IdentityIn most versions of the mythos, Gordon is ignorant of Batman's identity, though some fans and writers feel that Gordon is smart enough to solve the puzzle but chooses not to in order to preserve Batman's effectiveness. In the 1966 Batman theatrical movie, Gordon explicitly states his desire not to know for such a reason. In Batman: Year One, Gordon claims not to see the unmasked Batman well (whom his wife at that time, Barbara, also sees) because he doesn't have his glasses on. The Batman: The Animated Series episode \"Over the Edge\" ends with a conversation between Commissioner Gordon and Barbara (his daughter not his wife) which implies that Gordon at least knows that Barbara is Batgirl but cannot acknowledge it because that would put him in an uncomfortable legal position. During No Man's Land, Batman attempts to regain Gordon's trust by revealing himself, but Gordon turns his face away, stating that he does not want to know his identity.Likewise, in the 1980s Detective Comics storyline Blind Justice, the world at large incorrectly supposes Batman is dead and Gordon comments to Bruce Wayne that Batman has earned the right to retirement if he so desires. He then rather pointedly asks Bruce's advice on whether or not he should reveal that Batman still lives. In Batman: Year One, Gordon suspects early on that Bruce Wayne may be Batman, though he never follows up on his suspicions. In Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns, Gordon and Bruce Wayne are portrayed as close friends, with Bruce having revealed his identity to Gordon years ago.FamilyPre-CrisisIn Pre-Crisis continuity, James Gordon was the biological father of Anthony \"Tony\" Gordon and Barbara Gordon (later Batgirl). Originally referred to as a college student, Tony later disappeared while hiding from Communist spies. He was later reunited with his sister Barbara and perished in a battle with the Sino-Supermen. (Batman Family #12, Detective Comics # 482)Post-CrisisIn Post-Crisis continuity, there has been no mention of Tony Gordon. James Gordon has a brother, Roger Gordon. James and his wife, Barbara Eileen Gordon, are the parents of a son, James Gordon, Jr. (Batman #404-407)Roger Gordon and his wife, Thelma Gordon, are parents of Barbara \"Babs\" Gordon (later Batgirl and Oracle). When Babs was 12 or 13, her parents (Roger and Thelma) died. She moved to Gotham City and lived with her uncle, aunt and cousin. Eventually, James and Barbara adopted Babs. However, the couple divorced and James retained custody of Babs, while Barbara moved to Chicago with James, Jr. (Secret Origins #20). Barbara and James, Jr. are rarely mentioned and presumably still reside in Chicago. It has recently been revealed that James had an affair with Thelma, and might be the biological father of Babs. (Batman: Gotham Knights #6)In one post-crisis story, James and Babs visit the grave of his late wife. However, this story is later retconned when it is revealed that his wife is not dead, but instead they are divorced. James eventually marries Sarah Essen. (Batman Annual #13, Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight Annual #2). Unfortunately, Sarah was murdered by the Joker at the end of the No Man's Land storyline. During the One Year Later storyline, Gordon makes a slight reference to his ex-wife Barbara \"doing well,\" implying that he keeps tabs on her.FILMIn the 2005 film Batman Begins Gordon is popularly portrayed by Gary Oldman. The film partly concerns Gordon's rise from beat cop to Sergeant and, by the end of the film, Lieutenant. He did his best to comfort the eight-year-old Bruce Wayne after the murder of his parents when he was a young man, and Wayne later recognizes him as one of the few honest police officers in the city, and would always remember his kindness as it gave Bruce the strength he needs after his parents' death. Seventeen to eighteen years later, after promoted as a detective-sergeant on the force, while working late on his office, Bruce, wearing a ski-mask, visited Gordon's office, to ask Gordon about Carmine Falcone's criminal operation and the police inability to stop the notorious crimelord. When Bruce threatens Gordon with a common office stapler, which was thought to be a pistol, Bruce suggested that they form an alliance. This is kept secret from all other police officers, with Gordon proving pivotal in Batman's defeat of Ra's al Ghul by driving the Batmobile to destroy the Gotham monorail tracks and prevent the madman from vaporising the water supply. James Gordon's involvement in saving Gotham results in his promotion to the rank of lieutenant. He developed a Bat-Signal with the department's spare searchlight to summon Batman in times of need. Gordon called the Batman to announce his promotion on the force, his appreciation to the Dark Knight, and also to discuss a criminal whose identity is a mystery. The criminal has committed an armed robbery and double homicide, with an apparent taste for theatrics, leaving a calling card: a Joker playing card.Although he does not condone vigilantes, Gordon sees that it is necessary to operate outside of laws in the crime-filled Gotham City, especially since most members of Gotham's police department are mired in corruption. Before the emergence of Batman, he was increasingly jaded and disillusioned of the corruptions around him. The arrival of the Dark Knight gives the police detective the hope he needs to build a better Gotham for his wife and children. After being promoted as a lieutenant, he is determined to clean the department up from within. The detective is still clueless of who Batman is, or that he is one of the people who inspired the Dark Knight to be what he is now.James Gordon is a police lieutenant in the Gotham City Police Department. He has become a friend and ally to the Batman.From Wikipedia ( http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/James_Gordon_%28comics%29 ):","The man who essentially runs Wayne Enterprises for his employer Bruce Wayne, Lucius Fox is a highly moral family man who is only tolerant of his employer's caprices to a limited degree.

He had a very apathetic attitude to his job. It was later revealed that he was also a traitor secretly in league with the mob.Wuertz betrayed D.A. Harvey Dent and handed him over to the Joker's men. Unfortunately for Wuertz, Dent survived his captivity and later killed him.","The Scarecrow is Dr. Jonathan Crane. He is an enemy of Batman.He is a mentally unstable former psychiatrist who uses a variety of drugs and psychological tactics to utilize the fears and phobias of his adversaries.Crane at first works for Ra's al Ghul, developing and testing his fear toxin, capable of causing massive hallucinations based on one's worst fears.The fear toxin he uses is extracted from a mountaintop blue flower from China, and only works in vapour form. Crane also works to seemingly help captured mob henchmen for the powerful Falcone family, declaring the gangsters mentally unfit, thus allowing a transfer to Arkham Asylum, where Crane is able to continue his experiments on them.If attacked, or to inspire fear at close quarters, Crane has developed two delivery dispersal systems for his toxin: a small, gas-dispensing canister mounted in his briefcase proves useful in the close confines of Arkham Asylum; if in need of more mobility, he uses a wrist-mounted version of the dispenser. To create an automatic fear response to the toxin, Crane often wears a burlap sack mask, crudely stitched together to resemble the head of a scarecrow. Although the mask seems non-threatening to behold, when used with the toxin, it creates a terrifying visage.Crane's psychiatric abilities allow him to plan his moves carefully, weighing what he thinks others will do, and turning it to his advantage. His fierce, calculating intelligence also means that he invariably finds the idea of Batman amusing; if he could, Crane would give the Dark Knight a serious psychiatric analysis.After Ra's al Ghul's defeat at the hands of Batman, Crane goes freelance, peddling his fear toxin to criminals for a fee. Although he is captured by Batman and arrested, it's unlikely that this diabolical master of fear will truly be stopped for long.Crane reappears in Dark Knight Rises briefly. He's among the many inmates released from the Gotham in the massive riot to taking over the city. During the following months of 'Occupy New York' (I mean Occupy Gotham), Crane acts as a judge to sentence the rich and others who dare to fight the gangs, by allowing them to choice between death and exile.","null","null","\"Boss\" Maroni was one of Gotham City's biggest crime bosses, but his criminal career came to a close when\nhe was indicted by D.A.

At Rivendell, Frodo volunteers to take the Ring to Mount Doom to destroy it, and Sam volunteers to go with him.

Madril is a trusted officer and close friend of Faramir. He perishes in the fight to hold Osgiliath.","Boromir is the older son of Denethor II, Steward of Gondor, and older brother to Faramir. He first appears in The Fellowship of the Ring, at the Council of Elrond.As Sauron first begins to regain power in Middle-Earth, he also began attempting to invade Gondor. First, he had to break through the defenses of Osgiliath, a city on the Anduin River that separated Gondor from Mordor. Boromir and Faramir had successfully driven the enemy back when their father, Denethor, arrived, to tell Boromir that Elrond had summoned a council, without stating its purpose. Denethor, however, had deduced that the One Ring had been found. This coincided with a dream Boromir himself had had regarding Rivendell. Despite his own reluctance to leave his people behind, Boromir travelled to Rivendell at his father's request, and with orders to bring the Ring back to Gondor to help defend his country.At the council, however, he found himself alone in his mentality that the Ring could be used against Sauron. All the others agreed that the only way to defeat Sauron was to take the Ring to Mordor where it could be destroyed by casting it into Mount Doom. Frodo Baggins volunteered to take the Ring, and Boromir was among those whosen to accompany him. The others included the wizard Gandalf, the Ranger Aragorn, Gimli the dwarf, Legolas the elf, and three other hobbits: Sam Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took.The Fellowship faced many challenges while journeying to Mordor. At first, Gandalf tried to lead them sound along the Misty Mountains, but a flock of Crebain sent from the south to spy on them alerted Gandalf to the fact that Saruman was spying on them. He decided instead to go east over the mountains to avoid Saruman's spies. However, Saruman used his powers to hit the Fellowship with a blizzard, blocking the passage. Boromir proved himself useful in making parths through the snow and protecting the hobbits from the elements.With this road blocked to them, Gandalf instead lead them through Moria. Boromir also helped to defend the Fellowship against an onslaught of Orcs that attacked them during their passage. After Gandalf fell into the abyss under the bridge of Khazad-Dum, Aragorn assumed leadership of the Fellowship, and took them to Lothlorien.In Lothlorien, he became distraught over the fate of Gondor, and began to think that he would have to decide soon whether to take the Ring from Frodo, or continue to help him into Moria. After leaving Lothlorien, the Fellowship travelled in boats down the River Anduin, making camp on the western side of the Emyn Muil mountain range. There, Frodo snuck away from the Fellowship, but Boromir followed him, and made a last-minute attempt to get the Ring from Frodo, first by persuasion, and then by force. Frodo put on the Ring and escaped from Boromir, intending to go on alone. He was spotted by Merry and Pippin, who rather than try to stop him from leaving, helped by distracting an army of Orcs thathad just overtaken their camp site. Frodo managed to escape, but Merry and Pippin were outnumbered. A repentant Boromir came to their aid, successfully defending them from many Orcs, but even he was ounumbered. The leader of the Orcs, Lurtz, fired three arrows into Boromir, fatally wounding him, as the other Orcs took Merry and Pippin captive.Aragorn arrived soon after and killed Lurtz, but it was too late for Boromir. He expressed his remorse for trying to take the Ring from Frodo, and gave Aragorn--the rightful heir of Gondor--his blessing to be King, and then died. The remaining members of the Fellowship; Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas; placed Boromir's corpse in on of their boats and pushed him out into the River Anduin.Afterwards, his funeral boat was found by his brother, Faramir, who also took his broken horn and delivered it to their father, Denethor.","Noldorin princess, the daughter of Finarfin. Galadriel was the only woman to play a prominent role in the debate of the Noldor following the theft of the Silmarils, and, eager to return to Middle-earth, she was one of the leaders of the host of Fingolfin.In Middle-earth she dwealt with Finrod on Tol Sirion, but when her brother moved to Nargothrond, she went to Doriath, where she married Celeborn and was instructed in wisdom by Melian. She had one child, Celebrian. At the fall of Doriath she probably fled to Arvernien or the Mouths of Sirion. Galadriel was the only leader of the revolting Noldor to survive the Wars of Beleriand, and at the end of the First Age a ban was set on her return to Valinor.In the Second Age, Galadriel dwelt for a time in Lindon and Eregion, and then founded and became Queen of Lorien, which she made on the model of Doriath and the Girdle of Melian and sustained with the aid of her own power and that of Nenya, one of the Three Rings, which was given to her at its making. Throughout the Second and Third Ages Lorien remained safe from Sauron, for Galadriel's power was such that she knew his mind but hers was closed to him, and she could protect Lorien from assault by any power less than Sauron himself.During the War of the Ring, Galadriel gave shelter and great gifts to the Companions of the Ring, and she refused the One Ring when it was offered to her by Frodo. Because of this, and because of her endless opposition to Sauron, at the end of the Third Age the Valr permitted her to return to Valinor. Galadriel fulfilled her age-old desire in Third Age 3021, when she went over Sea with the Last Riding of the Keepers of the Rings.Galadriel was very tall and the greatest beauty of the house of Finwe; she had the golden hair of her mother's kindred.","Sindarin Elf of the Woodland Realm, son of Thranduil. In Third Age 3019 Legolas went to Rivendell as a messenger and took part in the Council of Elrond. He then became one of the Companions of the Ring, representing the Elves. In Lorien Legolas became very friendly with Gimli, a friendship which was maintained for the rest of their lives. After the breaking of the Fellowship, Legolas went with Aragorn and Gimli in search of Merry and Pippin, and they fought in the Battle of the Hornburg at Helm's Deep. He was one of the Grey Company, and fought in the Battle of Pelennor Fields. While in Southern Gondor Legolas for the first time saw the Sea, and the Eldarin yearning for Eldemar was awakened in him.After the War of the Ring Legolas led a number of Elves of the Woodland Realm to Ithilien, where they beautified the war ravaged land. In Fourth Age 120, after the death of Elessar, Legolas finally sailed over Sea, taking Gimli with him.","Peregrin Took (nicknamed 'Pippin\") is a Took and that should be description enough. Tooks dwell in the Shire in Tookborough. They're set apart from the rest of Hobbits because of their inquisitiveness and adventuresome spirit. Pippin journeys with Frodo to Rivendell and becomes a member of the Fellowship of the Ring. He and his cousin Meriadoc (called \"Merry\") are later separated from the rest of the Fellowship by an attack at Parth Gallen where Boromir of Gondor falls trying to protect them. Pippin and Merry are then carried away by Orcs under the command of Saruman to bring any halflings to Isengard. He and the Fellowship are not fully reunited again (excluding Boromir of course) until the end of the trilogy.In the third part of the trilogy Pippins swears an oath to Lord Denethor II, the steward of Gondor. He does this out of guilt for the death of Boromir, Denethor's first and favorite son. He is later released from his oath when Denethor, believing his second son, Faramir, to be dead, tries to burn both himself and Faramir alive. Pippin knows that Faramir is alive and calls Gandalf for help. When Aragorn takes the throne, Pippin is brought under oath again and he fights in the Battle of Mordor as a knight of Gondor.Pippin and Merry were known for being troublemakers in the Shire. But when they returned, they (along with their cousin Frodo and friend Sam) became heroes after leading the rebellion against Saruman, who had taken over the Shire in their absence. Pippin married Diamond of Long Cleeve, when she was 32 and he was 37. They had one son, Faramir. Faramir Took later married Samwise Gamgee's daughter Goldilocks. He and Merry became the two tallest Hobbits in their history, having drank Ent-draught. Pippin inherited his father's title and became 32nd Thain of the Shire, a position he held for 50 years before retiring and revisiting Rohan and Gondor with Merry. He remained in Gondor for the rest of his life.","null","null","Celeborn is the Lord of Lothl\u00f3rien and the husband of Lady GaladrielHe has a daughter with Galadriel named Celebrian, who married Lord Elrond.

His mother dies in childbirth. Jedi Masters Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi hide the children to prevent the newly declared Galactic Empire and its ruler, Palpatine, using them to gain greater control over the galaxy. Leia would go to Alderaan and grow up a princess, the adopted daughter of Senator Bail Organa, and Luke would be taken to the desert planet of Tatooine to be raised as a moisture farmer by his Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru. Obi-Wan would then go into exile on Tatooine to keep an eye on Luke during his formative years.19 years later, Luke lives a humdrum existence on Tatooine with his aunt and uncle, who have kept his father's true history a secret from him. He makes his first steps toward his destiny when he finds two droids, C-3PO and R2-D2; he meets Obi-Wan, whom he knows as the eccentric hermit \"Ben Kenobi\", for whom a message in R2-D2's memory system is intended. Obi-Wan tells him that his father was a Jedi, killed by Darth Vader. He then presents Luke with his father's lightsaber. Obi-Wan offers to take Luke to Alderaan, but Luke rejects his offer.Luke changes his mind when he discovers his aunt and uncle have been killed by Imperial stormtroopers. They catch a ride with the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca on their ship, the Millennium Falcon, only to find that Alderaan has been destroyed by the Empire's new superweapon, the Death Star.The group sneaks onto the Death Star and rescues a captive Princess Leia; in the process, Obi-Wan sacrifices himself in a duel with Vader. Luke is heartbroken, but finds the strength (with help from Obi-Wan's spirit) to join the Rebel Alliance and destroy the Death Star.Three years later, Luke is a commander in the Rebel Alliance. While on a mission on the ice planet Hoth, he is nearly killed by a Wampa; he escapes with the help of the Force and his lightsaber. In the frozen wasteland, he sees the spirit of Obi-Wan, who tells him to travel to the planet Dagobah and complete his training under Jedi Master Yoda. Han Solo then saves Luke from freezing to death, having rode out into the night to do so.When the Empire discovers the Rebel base on Hoth, Luke leads a snowspeeder squadron to cover the evacuation. Escaping Hoth in his X-wing, he travels to Dagobah, rather than regrouping with the Alliance. There, he meets Yoda and undergoes rigorous Jedi training, increasing his power in the Force.His training is interrupted by a vision of his friends in pain. Against Obi-Wan and Yoda's advice, he travels to Cloud City to save them, only to be lured into a lightsaber duel with Darth Vader. As his mentors warned, Luke proves to be no match for the powerful and experienced Vader. After losing his right hand, he learns the truth: Darth Vader is his father. Vader offers him the chance to turn to the dark side of the Force and rule the galaxy at his father's side. Horrified, Luke chooses to die rather than be corrupted and throws himself into a deep reactor chasm. However, he is sucked into a garbage chute to the underside of Cloud City and left hanging onto a weather vane. Leia, flying away from Cloud City in the Millennium Falcon, senses Luke's peril and turns the ship around to save him. Aboard the medical ship after rejoining the rebel fleet, Luke's missing hand is replaced with a robotic one.Luke, along with Leia, the droids, and Lando Calrissian, save Han Solo from the gangster Jabba the Hutt, who had acquired the carbonite-encased Solo after the events in the Cloud City. Luke offers to negotiate with Jabba, but instead is forced to fight a fearsome monster, the Rancor. When Luke kills it, Jabba sentences him to be thrown into a The Pit of Karcoon, to be eaten by the Sarlacc. Luke escapes with R2's help, saving his friends and destroying Jabba's barge. We also learn Luke has constructed a new green lightsaber.\nDuring the Battle of Endor, Vader confronts Luke in an attempt to turn him to the dark side.During his return trip to Dagobah, Luke learns from the dying Yoda that Vader is indeed his father, and from Obi-Wan's spirit that Leia is his twin sister. Yoda tells Luke that he will not truly be a Jedi until he confronts his father. Luke insists that there is still good left in Vader, and pledges to bring him back from the dark side.Arriving on Endor as part of a Rebel commando squad, Luke surrenders to Vader in an attempt to bring the Dark Lord back to the light side of the Force. He ultimately becomes a prisoner of the Emperor on the second Death Star, in orbit around Endor.The Emperor and Vader attempt to turn Luke to the dark side with promises to save his friends from certain death. When that fails, the Emperor goads Luke to strike him down to save the Rebels, who are losing the Battle of Endor. Luke momentarily lashes out, but Vader blocks his strike, and father and son face each other in a final duel. Luke tries to keep his emotions under control until Vader senses the existence of Luke's sister and threatens to turn her instead. Enraged, Luke attacks with full fury. Vader loses ground as Luke lands blow after blow; Luke eventually forces Vader on his back and severs his father's mechanical right arm. With The Emperor ordering Luke to strike Vader down to take his place, Luke glances at his own bionic hand and realizes with a visceral horror that he's on the verge of suffering his father's fate. Luke regains control, deactivates his lightsaber and emphatically throws it away, passing Yoda's final test and proudly declaring his allegiance to the Jedi.The Emperor uses Force lightning against Luke in retaliation, nearly killing him. In horrible pain, Luke calls out to his father for help. In an act of self-sacrifice, Vader seizes the Emperor and throws him to his death down a reactor shaft. In the process, Vader is mortally wounded. On the deteriorating Death Star, Luke (at his father's request) removes the mask that had encased Anakin Skywalker's face, and looks upon his father's eyes for the first and only time. Anakin dies moments later, assuring his son that there is still good in him after all. Luke escapes with his father's remains. On Endor, in the manner of a Jedi's funeral, Luke burns the last vestiges of his father that had been Darth Vader. During the Rebel Alliance's victory celebrations on Endor, Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan, Yoda, and his father.","Contents [hideshow]\n\n1. A New Hope\n2.  The Empire Strikes Back\n3.  Return of the Jedi\n\nA New Hope\nAt the beginning of A New Hope, Solo and Chewbacca are notorious smugglers. However, during one Kessel Run, the Imperial Navy intercepts and boards their ship, forcing Solo to jettison his cargo to avoid arrest. This results in a large and mounting debt to his former employer, Jabba the Hutt, who places a bounty on Solo's capture. Desperate to pay off his debt to Jabba, Solo accepts a charter to transport Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker, and their two droids to the planet Alderaan. As a result, Solo reluctantly becomes involved in the Rebel Alliance and helps them rescue Princess Leia from Imperial custody, though he claims he is \"only in it for the money,\" and parts ways with the rebels after delivering them to safety and receiving his payment. However, near the end, he has a change of heart, and helps Luke Skywalker destroy the Death Star at the Battle of Yavin. As a result, Solo is handsomely rewarded and given, along with Luke Skywalker, the Alderaanian Medal of Freedom. The Empire Strikes Back\nIn The Empire Strikes Back, set three years later, Solo again attempts to leave the Rebel Alliance as he is still being relentlessly pursued by Jabba's minions. However, he is once again dragged back into action when he saves Skywalker from freezing to death and Princess Leia from an Imperial invasion of the rebel base on Hoth. It is likely that Solo's personal feelings toward the princess played a major role in his decision. He takes her to hide on the planet Bespin, but his old friend Lando Calrissian betrays him and turns them over to Darth Vader, who was informed of their location by Solo's nemesis, bounty hunter Boba Fett. After being tortured by Vader, Solo's body is frozen in carbonite and given to Fett as a reward, who then delivers the incapacitated Solo to Jabba. Return of the Jedi\nSix months later, during the events of Return of the Jedi, Skywalker, now a nearly full-fledged Jedi, rescues Solo from Jabba (with help from Leia, Chewbacca, and a penitent Calrissian). Upon rejoining the rebels, Solo, now promoted to general, accepts their offer to lead the commando raid on an Imperial shield generator facility on the forest moon of Endor. By destroying the shield generator, they allow rebel fighters to enter the Death Star's superstructure and destroy it in the ensuing Battle of Endor, permanently crippling the Empire.","Contents [hideshow]\n\n1. Main Biography\n2. Expanded Biography\n\nMain Biography\nLeia Organa had accomplished much at a young age: a leader in the Alliance to Restore the Republic, a former member of the Imperial Senate, and a member of the Royal Family of Alderaan. Yet despite her stature, for many years, Leia herself was not privy to much of her true heritage.\nIt was common knowledge throughout the court that Leia was adopted into the Royal Family. What wasn't common knowledge was that Leia was born to Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi pupil who succumbed to the dark side and became Darth Vader. She was one of a set of twins, born in secrecy and protected from Vader and the Emperor. The Jedi hero and general, Obi-Wan Kenobi, saw to it that Leia was secretly transported to the planet Alderaan, where she was to be raised by Kenobi's friend Bail Organa. The boy, Luke, was taken to the distant world of Tatooine. Leia has few memories of her true mother, Padm\u00e9 Amidala. All that Leia can recall is that she was beautiful, but sad.Leia followed in her adoptive father's footsteps, and entered politics. She became the youngest senator ever in the Imperial Senate, representing Alderaan. As a senator, Princess Leia ran a number of \"diplomatic aid missions\" that were fronts for Rebel resupply missions. She used her diplomatic immunity and her consular ship to gain access to restricted areas.One such mission saw Leia's ship intercepting vital Imperial plans stolen by Rebel spies. These plans, the complete technical readouts of the Death Star battle station, could be exploited by the Alliance to secure a sizable victory over the Empire. Armed with the Death Star plans, Leia was given a mission by her father to find one of the Republic's greatest heroes and recruit him into the Alliance. En route to the planet Tatooine to find General Obi-Wan Kenobi, Leia's ship was attacked by Imperial forces, and she was taken prisoner by Lord Darth Vader. She barely had time to hide the stolen plans into the memory systems of an R2 unit, and ordered it to find Obi-Wan on Tatooine.As a prisoner of Vader, Leia underwent terrible torture aboard the Death Star. In addition to the mind probes, the Imperials forced her to witness the destruction of her home planet of Alderaan. Despite this, she refused to reveal the location of the hidden Rebel base, or the whereabouts of the stolen plans. Shortly thereafter, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo rescued her from the battle station and carried her and the stolen plans to the Rebel base on Yavin's fourth moon. Due to Leia's efforts, and the help of her companions, the Death Star was eventually destroyed.Three years later, the Alliance had set up a new base on the frozen world of Hoth. Princess Leia was one of the commanding members of Echo Base. When the Imperials attacked Hoth, Leia took the initiative, and acted in a number of command roles, ordering the evacuation of the base. Leia's access to her own escape transport was cut off, but she managed to escape in Han Solo's Millennium Falcon.Evading Imperial pursuit, the Falcon landed in an asteroid field so that its crew could repair the vessel. It was during these quiet moments that Princess Leia Organa fell in love with Han Solo. The two voiced their love on Cloud City of Bespin, where the Imperial forces tracked them. Darth Vader captured Han Solo, and Leia was forced to watch as the Dark Lord froze him in carbonite, and then handed him over to the bounty hunter, Boba Fett. Leia escaped Cloud City with the aid of its administrator, Lando Calrissian.The Rebels eventually tracked down Boba Fett as the bounty hunter delivered Han's carbon-frozen form to Jabba the Hutt. Leia participated in Luke's plan to free the captured Solo from the clutches of the vile gangster. She posed as Boushh, an Ubese bounty hunter and infiltrated the palace, freeing Solo from his carbonite imprisonment. Her identity was revealed, and for a time, she had to endure the humiliation of being made one of Jabba's slaves. She repaid the gangster, however, by strangling the Hutt with the very chain that bound her.Leia rejoined Alliance High Command in time to accompany General Han Solo's strike team on the moon of Endor. Their mission was to destroy the shield generator protecting the second Death Star. While on Endor, Leia became separated from the strike team, and befriended an Ewok tribe. Her diplomatic skills aided in convincing the Ewoks to help the Rebel force. It was shortly thereafter that Luke revealed their true lineage to her. For a time, Luke and Leia kept their true relation and their parentage a secret from all but their most trusted friends.During the ground battle at the Imperial complex, Leia sustained a slight blaster wound. After the victory at Endor, Leia continued to demonstrate some ability in the Force, being able to sense her brother's presence.Leia is a driven, dedicated individual. She has a forceful, some would say abrasive, personality. She is professional in all respects, but occasionally relaxes her guard to let her strong compassion and quirky sense of humor show. Leia is a petite, fair-skinned human female with brown eyes, and long brown hair that she often wears in an elaborate fashion.Expanded Biography\nLeia was raised in a life of privilege, a stark contrast to her twin brother who grew up on the harsh desert world of Tatooine. Despite this, Leia never grew soft or decadent. Her strong personality and bright intellect molded her into an exceptional person, one that Bail Organa loved and was very proud of. She avoided the vagaries of court politics and intrigue, and instead concentrated on bettering herself and helping others.\nLeia had a happy childhood, learning in the best institutes on Alderaan, and studying politics, history and art. Leia's interest in art was one of her main reasons for joining the Rebellion. Learning how the Empire controlled expression really cemented her devotion to the Alliance's cause. Leia learned history from one of the greatest professors in the galaxy, Arn Horada. She was taught self-defense and combat skills from Giles Durane, the Weapons Master.When the galaxy plunged into civil war, Leia's diplomacy and martial skills served the Rebel Alliance. On a diplomatic mission to Ralltiir, a world subjugated by the Empire, she discovered a wounded Rebel with information stored in his brain through hypnotic imprint. This Rebel had the news of the Death Star operation. Learning of the abominable weapon, Leia discovered that there was no redeeming the Empire. What was to some an ordered, structured government built on the ashes of a corrupt and ineffective Republic was to Leia a vile villain to be destroyed. One of her first open acts of Rebellion was simply self-defense -- Leia was attacked by Imperial Lord Tion for her Rebel affiliations, and she was forced to take his life.Fully committed to the Alliance cause, Leia's convictions were by no means swayed by the Alderaan tragedy. She continued to serve the Alliance in diplomatic capacities. En route to a conference on Circarpous IV, Luke and Leia crash-landed on the jungle planet Mimban. There, Leia was forced to face Darth Vader during a quest for the legendary Kaiburr Crystal. Leia held off the Dark Lord single-handedly with Luke's lightsaber before Skywalker was able to defeat him. Vader was merely toying with her, scarring her continuously with his deadly blade. Luke used the Kaiburr's healing power to mend Leia's grievous wounds.Leia attended an important Conference of Uncommitted Worlds on the planet Kabal after the Battle of Yavin. There, she recruited the Aquaris Freeholders to the Alliance. The Freeholders proved very resourceful and valuable when the Alliance abandoned Yavin as their base. During the Alliance relocation, Leia was able to access lost Organa resources of money and capital on Ord Mantell greatly needed for the Rebel war effort. Leia's efforts were also felt in the distant Minos Cluster, where she helped unify Rebellion against the Empire.In the months that followed the Battle of Hoth, Leia felt torn between her duties to the Rebellion and her devotion to Han. Although she and her friends continued their search for Boba Fett, she still had Alliance missions to undertake. In her devoted search for Solo, Leia found herself drawn into the underworld of Black Sun, a vast criminal syndicate that permeated the entire galaxy. There, she was almost seduced by Prince Xizor, the ruler of the organization. His handsome features and irresistible pheromones nearly wooed Leia to his side, but she overcame his temptation.After the Battle of Endor, Leia went on a number of diplomatic missions on behalf of the newly founded Alliance of Free Planets. When the New Republic replaced the interim government, Leia was one of the inner council members that helped shape its growth.Four years into the New Republic's rule, the normally isolationist government of the Hapes Consortium began making entreaties. The Hapan Prince Isolder proposed marriage to Leia, offering the vast wealth of the Hapes Cluster to the Republic in exchange for her hand. Han Solo would have none of it. In a characteristically brash and reckless move, Han kidnapped Leia and stole away to Dathomir, a world he won in an incredible game of sabacc. Though Solo was an expert at marksmanship, piloting and smuggling, his idea of the \"romantic\" could have definitely used some work. Despite eloping to a world full of evil Force-weilding witches and an Imperial garrison, Leia's heart still chose the scruffy-looking scoundrel over the dashing prince, and Han and Leia were married shortly thereafter.Now known as Leia Organa Solo and the New Republic Minister of State, she set out on her most challenging role: that of mother. Leia gave birth to twins, Jacen and Jaina, during one of the New Republic's most trying times. Against a backdrop of war unleashed by Imperial warlord Grand Admiral Thrawn, Leia delivered two healthy and very Force-sensitive babies. A year-and-a-half later, she had a third child, Anakin.When Mon Mothma stepped down from her position of Chief of State of the New Republic due to health issues, she passed on the mantle of leadership to Leia. Organa Solo ruled for several years, guiding the Republic through numerous crises as the government experienced growing pains.Though Leia stepped away from public office, she still remained a valuable member of the New Republic hierarchy. Her relief efforts during theYuuzhan Vong crisis are well known. The mother of full-grown Jedi Knights, Leia still brandishes her lightsaber and Jedi heritage, though she readily admits regret that her political career had interfered with her early Jedi training.Her connection to the Force helped her weather the trying times of the Yuuzhan Vong crisis. Leia struggled to keep her family together during the invasion, becoming the emotional anchor when the tragic death of Chewbacca deeply affected Han. Grief-stricken, Solo withdrew from his commitments as father and husband.Following a near-death experience on Duro, Leia and Han were reunited, and bolstered each other's strength, renewing their commitment and faith in their love. Such strength was vital, for more bloodshed was to scatter the Solo family. Leia's headstrong son, Anakin, died in a heroic mission into Yuuzhan Vong territory. The pain and anguish of that loss echoed through the Force, crippling Leia with despair.Yet she did not lose all hope. Her remaining two children also felt the loss of Anakin. Jacen was held captive by the Yuuzhan Vong, and most in the New Republic believed him dead. But Leia held onto her adamant belief that Jacen was still alive, even though he seemed undetectable through the Force. Jaina plunged herself into her dangerous career as a starfighter pilot, leading foolhardy sorties against the Yuuzhan Vong. The young pilot worked hard to build walls around her emotions, and even excluded her mother from her war-weary heart for a time. The two were eventually able to settle their differences.After months of uncertainty, the remnants of the Solo family were finally reunited as the fragments of the New Republic consolidated its push against the Yuuzhan Vong. While Leia stayed clear of any official involvement in the newly formed Galactic Alliance government, she continued her service as a skilled diplomat, flying missions into territories that had lost contact with the rest of the galaxy during the invasion, and attempting to weave together the fragments torn apart by the Yuuzhan Vong.","Contents [hideshow]\n\n1. Main Biography\n2. Extended Biography\n\nMain Biography\nCardplayer. Scoundrel. You'll like him. That was Han Solo's hurried precis on his old pal, Lando Calrissian. While the description is accurate, it barely scratches the surface of this complicated rogue. Calrissian is at home in the shadowy reaches of the fringe, the underworld culture that permeates the galaxy. While he has rubbed elbows with hunters, mercs, outlaws and gangsters, Lando's main difference is that his elbows were covered by some of the most expensive and fashionable clothes this side of the Core. Lando has style and class; some would say in excess. He is a man of sophisticated tastes, and settles for nothing short of the best in his surroundings, his belongings, his look, and his female companionship.\nHan and Lando go way back, you'll hear them say, but it hasn't always been friendship and camaraderie. Solo and Calrissian have been rivals in the past. A bitter point of contention between the two has been the ownership of the Millennium Falcon. The deceptively dilapidated freighter once belonged to Calrissian, and much to the gambler's chagrin, he lost it to Solo in a heated game of sabacc. Though Solo insists he won fair and square, Calrissian still questions Solo's victory, if only to goad the Corellian.Lando was the first of the two friends to go \"respectable,\" a fate worse than death to some smugglers. He distanced himself from the life on the run, and settled down in the floating metropolis of Cloud City, on the gas planet Bespin. Lando became baron-administrator of the city and its lucrative Tibanna gas mining operation. Where once he had only looked out for himself, Lando now found himself responsible for the lives of millions of Cloud City residents. Despite himself, Lando found that he had a knack for administrative duties, and enjoyed being a businessman and community leader as much as a cardshark.Lando's new world came crashing down around him when the Empire arrived at Cloud City. It was shortly after the Battle of Hoth when the Dark Lord, Darth Vader, and the masked bounty hunter Boba Fett came before him. They had tracked down the Falcon and its crew heading to Cloud City, and forced Calrissian to agree to turn Solo over to the Empire. In exchange, the Empire would not interfere with Cloud City, and allow it to remain an independent colony. Calrissian was torn -- was a friend's life worth more than the lives of his people?Reluctantly, Calrissian agreed to the Empire's plan and lured Solo into a trap. Throughout the ordeal, Vader kept altering his end of the bargain, and Calrissian was powerless to stop him. The gambler learned an important lesson: never deal with a Dark Lord.With all the cards on the table, Lando realized that he was set up to lose. Although Solo was captured, frozen in carbonite, and taken to the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt, Calrissian seized the initiative to redeem himself. He freed Solo's friends, Leia Organa and Chewbacca, and warned Cloud City's populace of the impending Imperial takeover. Calrissian, aboard the Millennium Falcon, led the escape from the city. He even helped rescue a wounded Luke Skywalker before returning the fugitive Rebels to the Alliance fleet.Calrissian volunteered in a daring mission to rescue Solo from Jabba the Hutt's fortress on Tatooine. He concealed himself in the armor of one of Jabba's many faceless skiff guards and infiltrated the palace. Lando was in perfect position when Skywalker sprung his rescue mission over the Great Pit of Carkoon.The skiff guards never knew they had a Rebel in their midst. Calrissian helped dispose of several of the guards protecting the prisoners, and piloted the rescue skiff that spirited away the newly liberated Solo and his friends.During the Battle of Endor, Calrissian again proved his mettle. Now a General in the Alliance Forces, Lando volunteered to spearhead the starfighter attack on the second Death Star while Admiral Ackbar led the capital ships. His past exploits in the Battle of Tanaab helped prepare him for the coming conflict. His unorthodox strategies worked well with Ackbar's more conservative tactics. When the Death Star proved operational, Ackbar was ready to retreat. Instead, Calrissian commanded the Alliance Fleet to engage the Imperial Fleet at point-blank range, offering limited protection from the Death Star's massive superlaser weapon.Once a Rebel strike team deactivated the Death Star's protective deflector shield, Lando led the starfighters into the station's incomplete superstructure. Lando, aboard the Falcon, flew point into the twisting narrow corridors of the Death Star's innards. Once in the massive reactor core, he loosed a volley of concussion missiles at the Death Star's exposed heart. He then outran the fantastic explosion that followed, and the Millennium Falcon emerged triumphantly from the dying Death Star.Extended Biography\nCrime lords, bounty hunters, Imperials, jealous husbands and the last known Sorcerer of Tund -- Lando has outrun them all with a winning combo of skill and luck. It took years of practice to get there -- Lando's first game of sabacc was a disaster when a misunderstanding of the rules led to big losses. Those days are far in the past, a past that Calrissian purposely keeps secretive. After all, a mysterious air is a sure way to attract the ladies.\nEarly in his fringe career, Lando acquired the Millennium Falcon in a game of chance. Embarrassment may have played a role in his accepting the less-than-desired prize, since Lando wasn't one to admit that he was a terrible pilot. He quickly hired a piloting droid to teach him the ropes. He got far more than he bargained for with the acquisition of the chromed starfish-shaped droid curiously named Vuffi Raa.Over the year he spent with Vuffi, Lando's skills grew as did the peril he found himself in. Rokur Gepta, the last known Sorcerer of Tund and ally of the Emperor, shanghaied Lando into a treasure hunting caper that saw the gambler inadvertently resurrect the long lost civilization of the Sharu. Calrissian ran afoul of Gepta again in the Oseon system, and once again in the ThonBoka nebula. In that sack-shaped cloud of dust and gas, Lando helped save an endangered spaceborne species known as the Oswaft from the actions of the Centrality fleet. Lando ended that escapade with enough credits to buy a city.Lando's wealth waxed and waned over the next few years, as he came into possession of such oddities as a used starship lot on Nar Shaddaa. The Falcon ended up here as Lando concentrated on newer vessels, like the stylish Cobra. When Lando lost a sabacc game to Han and forfeited a ship from his lot, he didn't expect the Corellian to choose the shabbiest -- but fastest -- ship, the Millennium Falcon.A short time later, Calrissian helped Han Solo in a strike against the Hutt spice-processing and slaving operations on Ylesia. Solo was romantically tied to a Rebel agent -- Bria Tharen -- who masterminded the assault, and used his fringe connections to recruit a number of smugglers for the mission. When Tharen doublecrossed Solo and kept the spoils of war for the Rebellion, Solo found himself unable to pay the promised rewards to the smugglers. This marked a major falling out between Calrissian and Solo, and the two parted ways never to see each other again for years.Calrissian's life took a major turn when he won the administrator title of Cloud City from its draconian ruler, Baron Raynor. The peculiarities of Cloud City laws were such that citizens of the floating metropolis were forbidden to gamble. Conversely, citizens didn't have to pay taxes -- it was the tourists who gambled and paid taxes. A man of Calrissian's wealth could care less about taxes -- it was the thrill of sabacc he wanted. To circumvent this law, Calrissian took to disguising himself as an old man in order to play in the city's casinos. A responsible administrator (one of the few in Cloud City's history), he made sure to lose all his winnings to the house by night's end.After being pulled into the Rebel fold, Calrissian helped on numerous Alliance missions. He also helped in the search for Han Solo, whose capture he felt very guilty about. Although he failed in stopping Boba Fett on the moon of Gall, he did participate in the rescue of Princess Leia Organa from the tempting clutches of Prince Xizor on Coruscant.Lando next infiltrated Jabba's palace, posing as skiff guard Tamtel Skreej. This put him in excellent position to assist Luke Skywalker when the young Jedi sprang his rescue mission to free Han.Once the Empire was defeated at Endor, Lando returned to civilian life, resigning his commission in the Alliance military. Although he assisted a few Republic military ventures -- such as the short-lived Senate Interplanetary Intelligence Network -- he instead concentrated on business and speculating. Calrissian became the administrator of Hologram Fun World, a mining operation on Nkllon, and a housing project deep in the heart of Coruscant. When the Republic needed him the most, however, Calrissian could be counted on to help. When the resurrected Emperor began his scourge of the Core Worlds, Lando resumed his rank of general and commanded a number of missions deep into enemy territory.Now, two decades after the victory at Endor, Lando has settled down. He is married to Tendra Risant, and ran a mining and processing operation on Destrillion and Dubrillion. Once again war encroached on Lando's quiet civilian life, and he was forced to evacuate his people when the Yuuzhan Vong invaded the planet. Always the businessman, Lando turned the war into a source of profit by founding Tendrando Arms. The company manufactures the Yuuzhan Vong-hunting YVH 1 droids, powerful combat automata that have proven effective against the alien invaders.","C-3PO, also spelled See-Threepio, also called Threepio for short, was a protocol droida droid specifically designed to interact with organics. C-3PO's TranLang III Communicator module combined with his AA-1 VerboBrain allowed him to be fluent in over six million forms of communication. He was also equipped with over thirty secondary functions. C-3PO was generally seen with his counterpart, R2-D2, a small, wheeled R2-series astromech droid. C-3PO's main function as a protocol droid was to assist with etiquette, customs, and translation so that meetings of different cultures ran smoothly. In his time, C-3PO loyally served over forty masters. He hated adventure and space travel, as they often resulted in him coming out on the wrong end of a fight, losing parts, and having them reattached, sometimes incorrectly. Together with R2-D2, C-3PO played a pivotal role in galactic history, however lowly he may have thought of himself.","Contents [hideshow]\n\n1. As Anakin Skywalker\n2. As Darth Vader\n\nAs Anakin SkywalkerAnakin Skywalker is the central character in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. The original and prequel trilogies follow Anakin's rise as a vessel of The Force, his fall to the dark side, and his ultimate redemption. In the begining Anakin is a Jedi Padawan, and later a Jedi Knight of legend.Anakin first appears as a selfless nine-year-old boy. Anakin and his mother, Shmi, are slaves in the service of Watto, a junk dealer. Anakin can build or repair nearly anything, evidenced by the creation of his own protocol droid, C-3PO, and podracer, each from salvaged parts. He is also a remarkable pilot with quick reflexes.Anakin is found on the planet Tatooine by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, who is convinced that he is the \"Chosen One\" foretold by the Jedi prophecy to bring balance to the Force. Shmi says that he has no father, and that she simply became pregnant with him. Over the course of the narrative, Qui-Gon Jinn goes on to discover that Anakin has the highest known number of midi-chlorians, a measure of Force-aptitude. Anakin forms a strong bond with Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, whom Qui-Gon and his padawan apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, are guarding.After winning Anakin's freedom in a podrace, Qui-Gon brings the boy to Coruscant and requests that the Jedi Council allow him to train Anakin. This request is denied, as the Council thinks that Anakin's future is clouded by the fear he exhibits. Ultimately, Anakin helps win the final battle against the villainous Trade Federation. A dying Qui-Gon, slain by Darth Maul, urges Obi-Wan to train Anakin, and Council leader Yoda reluctantly approves. The Republic's newly-elected Supreme Chancellor, Palpatine, befriends the boy, promising to \"watch his career with great interest.\"10 years later, Anakin, now twenty, is Obi-Wan's padawan. Because his natural abilities place him far above his peers, he has developed into an arrogant loner during his years of Jedi training, and has begun to chafe against Obi-Wan's authority.He is assigned to guard Padm\u00e9, and eventually falls in love with her, even though such emotional attachments are forbidden to Jedi. In conversation with Padm\u00e9, he reveals his affection for her, as well as his distrust of the political process and the need he perceives for there to be one strong leader.While guarding Padm\u00e9, Anakin senses that his mother is in danger. Upon returning to Tatooine, he finds his mother in a village of Tusken Raiders, but arrives too late; she has been tortured and beaten beyond help, and she dies in his arms. Seized by a blind rage, he slaughters the entire village, even the women and children. He returns with his mother's body, and tearfully confesses to Padm\u00e9, who forgives him.Anakin and Padm\u00e9 learn that Obi-Wan has been taken hostage by the droid forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a faction of star systems that want to secede from the Republic. They rush to to the planet Geonosis to rescue him where they are also captured. Faced with their impending demise in a gladiatorial arena, they profess their love to one another. Escaping the fray with the help of a cadre of Jedi and the clone army, Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Yoda engage Separatist leader and fallen Jedi Count Dooku in a lightsaber battle. Obi-Wan is injured in the battle and Anakin is forced to fight him alone. He is easily defeated by the older, more experienced warrior, who severs his lower right arm. Back on Naboo, Anakin's arm is replaced with a mechanical prosthetic, and he marries Padm\u00e9 in a secret ceremony with only C-3PO and his counterpart, R2-D2, to witness.Some years later, Anakin and Obi-Wan return from the Outer Rim to rescue a kidnapped Palpatine. They board the Invisible Hand, flagship of the Separatist fleet and its cyborg leader, General Grievous. Tracking the captive Chancellor to the observation deck, they encounter Count Dooku. A brief battle ensues, in which Dooku renders Obi-Wan unconscious. Once again, Anakin is set to duel with the Count alone. Wanting revenge for his earlier defeat on Geonosis, Anakin overpowers Dooku and neatly sears off both of his hands. Palpatine then commands Anakin to behead the shocked Count. Anakin gives in to his anger and complies, but instantly regrets it, as killing a defenseless prisoner is not the Jedi way.After rescuing the Chancellor, Anakin finds that the flagship is in critical condition, and, with some help from Obi-Wan, barely lands its front half safely on an airstrip.Anakin returns to Coruscant, where Padm\u00e9 tells him she is pregnant. He is initially overjoyed, but that night has a horrible nightmare of Padm\u00e9 dying in childbirth. He is extremely afraid this vision will come true, as it is similar to the one he had of his mother just before she died.Palpatine, who by now has amassed near-dictatorial power in the Senate, makes Anakin his representative on the Jedi Council. The suspicious Council accepts Anakin, but denies him the rank of Jedi Master, and tell him to spy on Palpatine. His pride wounded, Anakin loses all faith in the Council. Ultimately, the Chancellor offers him the chance to learn the dark side, which he claims holds the power to prevent death. Anakin realizes that Palpatine is the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, and reports Palpatine's secret to Jedi Master Mace Windu. He soon follows Windu to the Chancellor's office to make sure Palpatine is taken alive.Anakin arrives to find Windu holding his lightsaber on a disarmed Palpatine. Windu declares the Dark Lord of the Sith under arrest, but Palpatine defiantly unleashes a torrent of Force lightning at Windu. The Jedi Master deflects the lightning with his lightsaber back at Palpatine, hideously scarring his face. The attack continues unabated until Palpatine seemingly tires, giving Windu a chance to strike a deathblow. Anakin pleads with Windu to spare Palpatine's life, but Windu refuses, insisting that Palpatine is too dangerous to be kept alive. As Windu raises his lightsaber to deliver the final blow, Anakin intervenes, severing Windu's right hand. Palpatine then springs to life, bombarding him with Force lightning and hurling him out the window to his death. Anakin then submits to the dark side, and is dubbed Darth Vader. Vader's first task as a Sith Lord is to assault the Jedi Temple and to kill everyone inside, including the children. Vader is then sent to Mustafar to assassinate the Separatist leaders. After completing this task, he is met by Padm\u00e9, who pleads with him to flee Palpatine's grasp with her. He refuses, saying that the two of them can overthrow Palpatine and rule the galaxy together. Obi-Wan, who had hidden himself on Padm\u00e9's ship, suddenly emerges. Vader accuses Padm\u00e9 of conspiring against him, and uses the dark side to choke her into unconsciousness. Kenobi and Vader then engage in an intense lightsaber duel throughout the mining complex. At the end of the duel, Kenobi severs Vader's left arm and both of his legs. As Vader comes into contact with the molten metal, he catches fire and is nearly immolated. Obi-Wan leaves him to die, but Palpatine comes to Vader's rescue.Palpatine reconstructs his apprentice's ruined body with the iconic suit of black armor. Once Vader regains consciousness, Palpatine tells him that Padm\u00e9 had died as a result of Vader's anger. (She had in fact died in childbirth after delivering Luke and Leia.) This half-truth breaks what remains of Anakin's spirit, and he screams in torment. He is last seen overseeing the construction of the first Death Star at Palpatine's sideAs Darth VaderIn Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope and Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, Vader is depicted as the cunning, brutal enforcer of the Galactic Empire's rule across the galaxy. Vader serves as the apprentice of Emperor Palpatine, using the dark side of the Force to mercilessly pursue the Jedi and the Rebel Alliance to the ends of the galaxy. The prequel trilogy recounts the heroic rise and tragic fall of Vader's former self, Anakin Skywalker.Darth Vader is the primary antagonist: a dark, ruthless figure, out to capture, torture, or kill the films' heroes to prevent them from thwarting the Empire.In A New Hope, Vader is charged with recovering the stolen plans of the Death Star and finding the Rebel Alliance's secret base. He captures and tortures Princess Leia and, along with Death Star commander Grand Moff Tarkin, destroys her home world of Alderaan. Shortly afterward, he duels his former master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, who has arrived at the Death Star to rescue Leia, and cuts him down, turning him into a spirit in the Force. He then encounters Luke Skywalker during a battle over the Death Star, and senses in him a great strength in the Force; this is confirmed moments later when the boy destroys the battle station. He was about to shoot Luke down using his TIE fighter, but Han Solo disables his ship using the guns on the Millennium Falcon, and sends Vader spinning into space.In The Empire Strikes Back, Vader captures Leia, Han, Chewbacca, and C-3PO on the planet Bespin to lure Luke into a confrontation. He strikes a deal with the administrator of Cloud City, Lando Calrissian to give Han over to the bounty hunter Boba Fett, and has Solo frozen in carbonite. Luke, who has been partially trained by Yoda, duels Vader, but is eventually defeated, losing his right hand to Vader's lightsaber. Vader then reveals his true identity as Luke's father and offers Luke the chance to overthrow Palpatine and rule the galaxy as father and son. Luke refuses, throwing himself down a mine shaft. He is sucked into a garbage chute and rescued by Leia, Chewbacca, Lando and C-3PO. He is fitted with a robotic hand to replace the one Vader had cut off.In Return of the Jedi, Vader is charged with overseeing the completion of the second Death Star. He meets with Palpatine on board the half-constructed station to plan Luke's turn to the dark side.\nDarth Vader escorting Luke Skywalker to Palpatine in an attempt to turn him to the dark sideBy this time, Luke has nearly completed his Jedi training, and has learned from a dying Yoda that Vader is indeed his father. He learns about his father's past from Obi-Wan's spirit, and also learns that Leia is his sister. On a mission to the forest moon of Endor, he surrenders to Imperial troops and is brought to Vader. Aboard the Death Star, Luke resists the Emperor's appeals to his anger and fear for his friends, but snaps when Vader telepathically probes his mind, learns of Leia's existence, and threatens to turn her instead. Enraged, Luke nearly kills Vader, severing his father's right hand. He controls his anger at the last minute, however, as he looks at Vader's cybernetic hand and then at his own; he realizes that he is perilously close to suffering his father's fate.As the Emperor approaches, encouraging Luke to kill Vader and take his place, Luke throws down his lightsaber, refusing to perform the killing blow. Angered, the Emperor attacks Luke with Force lightning. Luke writhes in agony under the Emperor's torture, begging his father for help. Unable to bear the sight of his son in pain, Vader turns on his master and throws him into the very core of the Death Star, where the evil emperor explodes in a fury of dark energies. However, Vader is mortally wounded by the Force lightning.Anakin Skywalker in his last few moments of lifeMoments from death, he begs his son to take off his breath-mask so he can look at Luke \"with his own eyes\". Luke complies and for the first (and as it turns out, the only) time, father and son truly see each other. In his dying breaths, Anakin Skywalker is redeemed, finally admitting to Luke that the good within him was not destroyed after all. Luke escapes with his father's body as the Death Star explodes, destroyed by the Rebel Alliance.That night, Luke cremates his father in his armor in the manner of a Jedi's funeral. During the victory celebration on the forest moon of Endor, Luke sees the redeemed spirit of Anakin Skywalker, standing once again with Obi-Wan and Yoda.","Contents [hideshow]\n\n1. Main Biography\n2. Additional History\n\nMain Biography\nAn immense, fur covered warrior of great strength and loyalty, Chewbacca the Wookiee was a well-known figure in both the underworld and in the Rebel Alliance. Born on Kashyyyk over two centuries before the Battle of Yavin, Chewbacca was a wise, sophisticated being with exceptional skills in starship piloting and repair.\nChewbacca is a veteran of the Clone Wars, the galaxy-wide conflict that pitted the clone armies of the Republic against the droid forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Wookiee was part of the high command tasked with protecting Kashyyyk from droid invasion. There, he served with fellow Wookiee Tarfful and the Jedi Master Yoda.The wise Yoda had maintained a good relationship with the denizens of Kashyyyk, earning the respect of the mighty Wookiees. When events surrounding the rise of the Empire resulted in the clone forces betraying their Jedi generals, Chewbacca and Tarfful remained loyal to Yoda, helping the Jedi Master escape the clone trap.For their brutish strength and technological savvy, Wookiees were enslaved by the Empire for use as labor. For a time, Chewbacca was a slave, toiling away for the betterment of the Empire until an impudent Imperial cadet named Han Solo freed him.Drummed out of the military, Solo had few options but to return to the fringe lifestyle he knew so well. Chewbacca swore loyalty to Han, and became his partner in crime. The two of them became a well-known smuggling duo. When they came into ownership of the freighter Millennium Falcon, their exploits became legendary.Chewbacca and Solo spent hours modifying and tinkering on their beloved Falcon, souping it up far beyond its original performance specs. Although the Falcon's upkeep was a labor of love, many a time Chewie unleashed his legendary temper on the recalcitrant freighter, banging his massive furry hands against delicate components that refused to behave.Chewbacca became Solo's conscience of sorts. Though the smuggler maintained a mercenary air of bravado that refused to adhere to any ideals other than self-preservation, Chewie was openly the more compassionate of the two. Perhaps it was the ordeal suffered by his people at the hands of the Empire that caused Chewie to feel this way. Although Solo steered clear of any allegiance during the Galactic Civil War, Chewbacca definitely supported the Rebel cause, though the two of them tried to avoid the struggle altogether.Ironically, a simple steerage assignment landed them in the heart of the Rebel Alliance. Desperate for cash, Chewie and Han took on a charter of two passengers and their droids from Tatooine to Alderaan. Little did the two smugglers realize that their cargo consisted of a legendary Jedi Knight, the son of the prophesied Chosen One in Jedi mythology, and a pair of droids containing information vital to both the Empire and the Alliance. This trip inextricably drew Chewbacca and Solo into the Rebel fold, and they continued flying missions for the Rebellion for years after that.Chewbacca stood over two meters tall and had a coat of ginger-brown fur. He wore nothing, save for a bandoleer that held specialized ammunition for the bowcaster that he carried, and a simple tool pouch so that he could enact the many repairs the chronically malfunctioning Falcon required.Additional History\nUnlike most Wookiees who rarely stray from the lush forests of Kashyyyk, Chewbacca's youthful wanderlust took him far from the confines of his green homeworld. His travels first included many remote and dangerous locales on Kashyyyk before taking him to the stars. Chewbacca's heart, however, was firmly rooted on Kashyyyk, and he would always try to make it home for important Wookiee holidays to share with his family.\nFollowing the Clone Wars, the Empire subjugated the planet -- ostensibly to punish the world for harboring Jedi fugitives, but mostly to exploit the Wookiees as slave labor. Chewbacca escaped capture for a time, helping his people as best as he could while living the life of a fugitive.Early on in their smuggling career, Chewbacca stunned Han Solo by returning to Kashyyyk to marry a female Wookiee named Mallatobuck. Solo never pegged Chewie as a family man, but Wookiee customs allowed Chewbacca to continue his flying with Han -- protecting him as the Wookiee life debt demanded -- while still being a husband and, eventually, father. Chewbacca's son, Lumpawarrump, was raised mainly by Malla and Chewie's father, Attichitcuk. Chewie continued to fly the spacelanes, avoiding Imperial patrols and smuggling contraband for various clients, but he returned often to Kashyyyk, to celebrate the Wookiee holiday of Life Day.Wookiees define family differently than most species. To a Wookiee, an \"honor family\" contains the closest of friends, and Chewbacca swore loyalty to all of them, offering protection even at great personal risk. When Han Solo and Leia Organa married and began to raise their own family, Chewbacca took their children into his honor family, and helped guard and raise the three young Solos -- Jacen, Jaina and Anakin.When Chewbacca learned that Solo had been captured by the bloodthirsty Yevetha during the Black Fleet Crisis, he disobeyed Leia's orders and flew straight into the heart of enemy territory: the Koornacht cluster. With the help of his cousins Jowdrrl, Dryanta, and Shoran, and his son, Lumpawarrump, he rescued Han from Yevethan clutches.At the start of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, Han Solo and Chewbacca were on the planet of Sernpidal when it became a target of the alien menace. Using massive gravity-altering creatures called dovin basals, the Yuuzhan Vong began to drag Sernpidal's moon of Dobido from its orbit to the planet's surface. Han Solo, his teenaged son Anakin, and Chewbacca began organizing a desperate evacuation, cramming as many escapees aboard the Falcon as they could.Solo and Chewbacca have had many close calls in the past, and have executed countless last-second escapes; Sernpidal was not to be one of them. As the moon rushed closer to the surface, Chewbacca was cut off from the Falcon. Anakin was faced with a terrible decision. The Falcon could not wait any longer. Rather than endanger everyone aboard, Anakin piloted the ship away, leaving Chewbacca behind. Chewbacca stood his ground, howling defiantly at the immense moon as it crashed into Sernpidal's surface, killing the mighty Wookiee.","R2-D2, phonetically spelled Artoo-Detoo or Artoo, was an astromech droid and undoubtedly the most famous unit of the R2 series. A longtime friend and counterpart of the protocol droid C-3PO, he served the Skywalker family faithfully for many years. Along with his resourcefulness, R2-D2 was equipped by his original owners, the Royal House of Naboo and the Royal Naboo Starfighter Corps, with many tool-tipped appendages that allowed him to serve as a superior starship mechanic and computer interface specialist. A bold droid in personality and temperament, R2-D2 would often enter dangerous situations without second thought in order to give aid to his masters. This adventurous streak served his companions well on numerous occasions, often turning the tide of galactic history.R2-D2 was a diminutive droid, standing 0.96 meters tall. He rolled on three legs, one could retract into his body, and had a silver and blue domed head. His white, blue, and silver body housed many arms, sensors, and other apparatuses, many of which were not readily seen by the typical humanoid eye. This often made the droid seem like a box of tricks, unexpectedly pulling out some previously unseen but much needed device at a critical moment.While R2-D2 contained many specialized gadgets, he was also quite good at taking the initiative and often employed unorthodox means to help his friends.","Contents [hideshow]\n\n1.  The Phantom Menace\n2.  Attack of the Clones\n3.  Clone Wars\n4.  Revenge of the Sith\n5.  The Empire Strikes Back\n6.  Return of the Jedi\n\n The Phantom Menace\nIn the timeline of the films, Yoda first appears in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. In that film, Qui-Gon brings the young Anakin Skywalker to the Jedi Council, claiming that the boy is the \"Chosen One\" who will bring balance to the Force, and requests to train him once Obi-Wan has completed the trials necessary to become a Jedi Knight. As told to young Anakin Skywalker, \" Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering..' Yoda plays a key role in that body's initial decision to deny the request; he believes that the boy is clearly affected by his years as a slave, and that he still clings too tightly to the memory of his mother to be trained safely. Yoda thinks his future is clouded.After Qui-Gon's death at the hands of Darth Maul, however, the Jedi Council rescinds their previous decision, despite Yoda's misgivings. Attack of the Clones\nIn Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, set 10 years later, Yoda is a key Republic general at the Battle of Geonosis, when the clone trooper Army of the Republic is first deployed. He leads the group which rescues Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala from execution at the hands of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, aka the Separatists. At the climax of the battle, Yoda duels with Separatist leader and Sith Lord Count Dooku, who was once Yoda's Jedi apprentice. This confrontation ends with Dooku making his escape by threatening Yoda's injured comrades, Anakin and Obi-Wan. Although seemingly frail, the ancient Yoda demonstrates a legendary agility and mastery of lightsaber combat and acrobatics. Clone Wars\nDuring the Clone Wars micro series Yoda is made a General like many of the Jedi Knights and Masters. Yoda escorts Padm\u00e9 on their journey to a planet but Yoda senses several Jedi in distress on Illum and uses the Jedi mind trick to convince Captain Typho to take them there. Yoda saves the two Jedi and finds a message of Dooku giving the orders to destroy the Jedi Temple.As the Clone Wars progress Yoda fights alongside Mace Windu in the Battle of Coruscant and is the one who tries to understand with Master Windu the logic behind the Sepratists massive attack on the Republic Capital. The two Jedi Masters realize that this is a distraction for Grievous to kidnap the Chancellor. Windu goes onto a Clone Hanger to try and prevent the kidnapping. Revenge of the Sith\nIn Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, Yoda leads the Jedi Council in seeking out the mysterious Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Yoda uses his incredible sensitivity and power with the Force to sense the Sith Lord's presence, finally concluding that Sidious is someone within Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's inner circle. Palpatine himself sidetracks the mission, however; by now, the Chancellor has amassed near-absolute power in the Galactic Senate, and begins interfering in Jedi affairs. He appoints Anakin as his personal representative on the Council, which would effectively grant the headstrong young man the rank of Jedi Master. The Council denies Anakin the promotion, however, fearing that giving Palpatine's representative the rank of Master would be the same as giving Palpatine himself a vote in the Council. Embittered by the perceived snub, Anakin begins to lose faith in the Jedi.Earlier, Anakin seeks Yoda's counsel about his intense, prophetic visions that someone close to him will die (he does not tell the Jedi Master that the \"someone\" is Padm\u00e9, now his secret wife and pregnant with his child; emotional attachments are forbidden by the Jedi Code.) Yoda, unaware of the intensity of Anakin's love for Padm\u00e9, tells him to \"Train yourself to let go... of everything you fear to lose.\" Unsatisfied, Anakin instead turns to Palpatine, who reveals himself as none other than Darth Sidious, and manipulates the young Jedi into becoming his Sith apprentice Darth Vader with the promise that, with powers only the dark side can give, he can save his wife.When Palpatine, now self-appointed Emperor of the Galactic Empire, implements Order 66, Yoda is on Kashyyyk, overseeing the battle between the Separatist forces and a combined command of clone troopers and Wookiees. Through the Force, he feels the deaths of each of the Jedi as they are cut down by the very troops they commanded. He swiftly kills the clone troopers sent to dispatch him, escapes with the help of Wookiee leaders Tarfful and Chewbacca, and returns to Coruscant, where he and Obi-Wan fight their way into the Jedi Temple to stop a trap for any Jedi who also survived Order 66. Upon discovering a holographic recording revealing Anakin as the assassin, Yoda sends Obi-Wan to kill his former Padawan. Obi-Wan tells Yoda he cannot fight Anakin, but Yoda insists, saying, \"To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough you are not.\"Subsequently, Yoda battles Palpatine in a titanic struggle that wrecks the Senate building. The fight seems evenly matched between the two patriarchs of both sides of the Force, neither able to overcome the other. Unable to defeat the Sith Lord, Yoda is forced to retreat and go into exile so that he may hide from the Empire and wait for another opportunity to destroy the Sith.Meanwhile, Anakin is defeated by Obi-Wan, losing his limbs and nearly burning to death. The cybernetic enhancements Palpatine administers to save his life render him (seemingly) less than human. His transformation into a fearsome cyborg serves as a grim fulfillment to Yoda's words to Obi-Wan upon learning of Anakin's fall from grace: \"The boy you trained, gone he is, consumed by Darth Vader.\"At the end, it is revealed that Yoda has been in contact with Qui-Gon's spirit. Although this is given little attention in the film, the novelization revealed that Yoda actually becomes Padawan to the deceased Jedi Master's Force ghost, learning the secret of immortality from him and passing it on to Obi-Wan.Yoda is also instrumental in deciding the fate of the Skywalker children after Padm\u00e9 dies in childbirth, recommending that Luke and Leia be hidden from Darth Vader and Palpatine in remote locations. Other than the ancient Jedi Master, only the Organas, the Lars, and Obi-Wan know of their placement. Originally, Obi-Wan wants to have both Yoda and himself take one child each to separate spots and train the children in the ways of the Force, but Yoda realizes that there are other ways to learn discipline than just Jedi training, and that Luke and Leia will need to be trained differently if they are going to defeat the Empire. In addition, the twins' anonymity would be more difficult to protect if the Sith were to discover the remaining Jedi Knights before Luke and\/or Leia were ready. Yoda then retreats to Dagobah. The Empire Strikes Back\nIn Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, set 22 years after Revenge of the Sith, Luke Skywalker arrives on Dagobah to seek Yoda's guidance. This happens after Luke is instructed to do so, by the Force-ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Obi-Wan had sacrificed himself in a duel with Vader in A New Hope).This is Yoda's first appearance, the most beloved and best-remembered of all. Yoda's appearance was based on Freeborn, but Freeborn gave the design eyes based on Albert Einstein's. The puppet was fully operated by Frank Oz, with two technical assistants guiding him on the soundstage.After initial reluctance, Yoda agrees to teach Luke in the ways of the Force. Prior to finishing his training, however, Luke chooses to leave Dagobah in order to confront Darth Vader and save his friends from the Empire's grasp at Bespin. Yoda insists to Luke that he is being lured into a trap, and that he must stay to complete his training. However, Luke cannot forsake his friends who are in danger. He promises to return to complete his training. Return of the Jedi\nYoda's final chronological appearance is in Return of the Jedi, set a year later. Yoda, sick and greatly weakened by old age, informs Luke that he has completed his training but will not be a Jedi until he confronts Darth Vader; he also confirms that Vader is Luke's father, which the Sith Lord had told a shocked Luke in the previous film. Yoda then dies at the age of 900 and becomes \"one with the Force.\" He leaves Luke with the knowledge that \"there is another Skywalker.\" Moments later, Obi-Wan's Force ghost helps Luke come to the realization that the sibling Yoda spoke of is none other than Leia.\nWhen the Emperor tries to kill Luke with Force lightning, Vader redeems himself and once again becomes Anakin Skywalker. By killing his master to save his son, he fulfills the prophecy and brings balance to the Force. Anakin dies in his son's arms as the Death Star crumbles around them. Later that night, Luke sees his father's spirit looking at him with pride and gratitude, in the company of Obi-Wan Kenobi and their once and future master, Yoda.","Obi-Wan Kenobi is a Jedi Knight, and a major character in the Star Wars saga. He is one of only four characters; the others being Anakin Skywaker, C-3PO and R2-D2; who appears in all six films. Obi-Wan acts as a mentor to Anakin Skywalker and his son Luke Skywalker.\n\n\nContents [hideshow]\n\n1.  Prequel trilogy\n1.1.  The Phantom Menace\n1.2.  Attack of the Clones\n1.3.

Return of the Jedi\n\n Prequel trilogy\n The Phantom Menace\nIn The Phantom Menace, 25-year-old Obi-Wan accompanies Qui-Gon on a mission to Naboo, a planet ruled by Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala. After making an unscheduled landing on Tatooine, his master stumbles upon Anakin Skywalker, a young slave who shows tremendous potential with the Force. Believing the boy to be the prophesied \"Chosen One\" who would bring balance to the Force by destroying the Sith, Qui-Gon asks the Jedi Council that the boy to be trained as a Jedi. Obi-Wan is also amazed by Anakin's unprecedented midi-chlorian count and strong Force potential, but initially thinks he should not be trained, believing the boy is already too old and has too many emotional attachments to become a Jedi. The Jedi Council agrees, and forbids training for Anakin, in whom they see a great deal of fear and anger.During the film's climactic battle scene, Queen Amidala and her entourage of guards split up from her Jedi bodyguards when the Sith Lord Darth Maul arrives to eliminate the Queen. Wielding a double-bladed lightsaber, Maul simultaneously battles both Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. After being separated from the duel via laser walls, Obi-Wan watches in horror as Maul impales his master. Obi-Wan engages Maul in a fierce duel, cutting Maul's lightsaber in half, but the Sith Lord knocks Obi-Wan into a reactor chasm and kicks his lightsaber into the depths below. Obi-Wan grabs onto an extending pole, breaking his fall. He then calms himself and reconnects with the Force, utilizing it to hurl himself into the air and simultaneously bring his master's lightsaber into his hand, startling Maul and giving him just enough time to slash the Sith Lord in half. The dying Qui-Gon tells Obi-Wan to train Anakin to be a Jedi, and Obi-Wan promises that he will.For his heroics in defeating a Sith (making him the first Jedi in 1,000 years to do so), Yoda personally bestows the rank of Jedi Knight upon Obi-Wan, who then says that he would take it upon himself to train Anakin whether the Council allowed him to or not. Yoda reluctantly agrees, but warns Obi-Wan to be careful with the troubled boy. Attack of the Clones\nIn Attack of the Clones, set 10 years later, Obi-Wan has become an experienced Jedi Knight. By this time, his relationship with his padawan is strained; Anakin has grown powerful but arrogant, and believes that his Master is trying to hold him back.He and Anakin are tasked with protecting Padm\u00e9, now a Senator, after an attempt is made on her life. Obi-Wan tracks the mysterious assassin to the planet Kamino, and learns about a massive clone army that the planet's inhabitants are building for the Galactic Republic. He then meets with the bounty hunter Jango Fett, the template for the clones, and figures out that he is the one responsible for the assassination attempts on Padm\u00e9. Obi-Wan attempts to apprehend Fett, who escapes to Geonosis with his unaltered clone Boba. Obi-Wan follows them by placing a homing beacon on Fett's ship, Slave I.On Geonosis, Obi-Wan learns of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, also known as the Separatists, a conspiracy of star systems that wants to secede from the Republic. The renegades are led by rogue Jedi Count Dooku, who was once Qui-Gon's master. Obi-Wan is captured shortly after sending a message to Anakin. While in captivity, Dooku reveals that the Galactic Senate is under the control of a Sith Lord called Darth Sidious.Later, Anakin and Padm\u00e9 arrive on Geonosis to rescue Obi-Wan. They are themselves captured, however, and all three are sentenced to death by the Geonosians. The executions are prevented by the timely arrival of Jedi and clone reinforcements, led by Jedi Masters Mace Windu and Yoda. Obi-Wan and Anakin confront Dooku and engage him in a lightsaber duel. Dooku strikes Anakin with Force lightning, then turns the deadly barrage onto Obi-Wan, who easily blocks the attack with his lightsaber. The two duel and Dooku outmaneuvers Obi-Wan, striking him on both his left arm and leg. Dooku is about to deliver a killing blow when Anakin recovers from the lightning and blocks Dooku's attack. Dooku and Anakin fight a short duel, and Dooku cuts off Anakin's right arm (which is later replaced by a robotic prosthetic). Yoda arrives and fights Dooku as well, but the Sith escapes; he creates a distraction by nearly killing Obi-Wan and Anakin. Revenge of the Sith\nIn Revenge of the Sith, set three years later, Obi-Wan and Anakin board the Separatist leader General Grievous' flagship, the Invisible Hand, and fight their way to the captive Chancellor Palpatine. There, they find Dooku, who engages them both in a duel. During the duel, Obi-Wan is rendered unconscious, leaving Anakin to face Dooku alone. Anakin defeats Dooku and, at Palpatine's urging, executes the defenseless Count, in violation of the Jedi Code.When Palpatine appoints Anakin to the Jedi Council as his representative, the Council disapproves, considering Anakin too young and headstrong, and reasons that his membership gives the Chancellor a vote in Jedi affairs. Anakin protests when the Jedi Council denies him the rank of Master and orders him to spy on Palpatine, but Obi-Wan talks him into accepting it, warning Anakin of his \"dangerous\" friendship with the Chancellor.Obi-Wan is called away to Utapau to confront General Grievous. This leaves Palpatine, who is secretly Darth Sidious, free to continue corrupting Anakin. The Sith Lord eventually manipulates the young Jedi into embracing the dark side as the Sith Lord Darth Vader.Obi-Wan engages Grievous in combat and shoots and kills him with a blaster. Moments later, however, Obi-Wan's own clone forces turn on him; Unbeknown to Obi-Wan, Palpatine had issued Order 66, directing clone troopers to turn on their Jedi generals. Obi-Wan survives the attempt on his life and escapes by stealing Grievous' star fighter and rendezvousing with Senator Bail Organa and Yoda aboard Bail's ship, the Tantive IV.Along with Yoda and Bail, Obi-Wan returns to Coruscant, where he and Yoda discover that every Jedi in the Jedi Temple has been murdered, even the younglings. They kill the clones remaining at the Temple, and discover that the clones were led there by Anakin. Obi-Wan reprogrammes a beacon, which had been instructing all remaining Jedi to return to the Jedi Temple (where they surely would be killed), by instructing them to scatter across the galaxy and remain in hiding. Subsequently, Obi-Wan and Yoda split up to confront the two Sith Lords, Darth Vader and Darth Sidious. Obi-Wan wishes to fight Sidious, hating the thought of having to kill his friend and pupil. Yoda, however, insists that Obi-Wan telling him \"to fight this Lord Sidious strong enough you are not\", and that he will have to accept that Anakin had been \"consumed by Darth Vader.\"Unaware of his former Padawan's location, Obi-Wan goes to visit Padm\u00e9, who secretly married Anakin and is now pregnant with his child. He tells her what Anakin has done, and reveals that he knows about their marriage. A horrified Padm\u00e9 refuses to accept what Obi-Wan tells her, but is brave enough to go out and confront Anakin herself. Obi-Wan stows away in her ship.Obi-Wan finds Vader at the volcanic planet Mustafar, and attempts to reason with his former student to pull him away from the dark side. When he emerges from Padm\u00e9's ship, however, Vader immediately suspects that Padm\u00e9 has betrayed him, and uses the dark side to force choke her into unconsciousness. Obi-Wan has no choice but to engage him in a long and epic duel, which ranges through the Mustafar mining complex, the lava rivers, and finally the black sand. Obi-Wan tries to persuade Vader to relent, but Vader ignores his warnings and leaps forward to deliver the killing blow. Obi-Wan sees an opening and severs Vader's legs and remaining arm with one stroke. Obi-Wan refuses to finish him off however, and leaves him burning on the volcanic slopes, taking Anakin's lightsaber with him. Vader then slides too close to the lava and nearly burns to death. He survives long enough to be rescued by Palpatine, and is later placed in the iconic black body armor first seen in \"Revenge of the Sith\" and the rest of the original triology.Obi-Wan assists in hiding Anakin's children after Padm\u00e9 dies in childbirth. Luke is put on Tatooine with Owen Lars, so that Obi-Wan can look after him in secret, while his twin sister Leia is put on Alderaan in Bail's care. Yoda then tells Obi-Wan that he has more training for him: the spirit of Qui-Gon would teach him how to retain his identity through the Force and commune with the living after death. Original trilogy A New Hope\nIn A New Hope, Obi-Wan is known to the inhabitants of Tatooine as Ben Kenobi, an eccentric hermit who lives in the Jundland Wastes (he had assumed this identity to hide from the Empire). He's first seen rescuing Luke Skywalker from Tusken Raiders while the boy looks for R2-D2. Obi-Wan presents Luke with Anakin's lightsaber, but when Luke asks Obi-Wan about his father, Obi-Wan disguises the truth from him, saying, \"a young Jedi named Darth Vader... betrayed and murdered your father.\" (Obi-Wan reasoned in Return of the Jedi that Anakin Skywalker died the moment he betrayed the Jedi, completely becoming Darth Vader). R2-D2 then plays the message from Princess Leia Organa asking for Obi-Wan's help in delivering the schematics of the Death Star to her foster father on Alderaan. Obi-Wan invites Luke accompany him to Alderaan and aid the Rebellion against the Empire, but Luke initially refuses. However, when Luke discovers that Imperial troopers hunting down the stolen Death Star plans have killed his uncle and aunt and destroyed their home, he changes his mind. Obi-Wan takes young Luke under his wing in order to teach him the ways of the Force with the intention of fully training the boy later on Alderaan.Obi-Wan and Luke buy passage to Alderaan on the Millennium Falcon, a freight ship owned by smuggler Han Solo and co-piloted by Chewbacca, a Wookiee. Before they can reach their destination, however, Alderaan is destroyed by the Death Star on the orders of Grand Moff Tarkin. The Millennium Falcon is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam. By a quirk of fate, Princess Leia is on board, and her rescue is gallantly executed by Han and Luke. Obi-Wan, meanwhile, sets off to disable the tractor beam so that the Falcon can escape. Obi-Wan is aware of Vader's presence, and knows he isn't coming back. He deactivates the tractor beam and confronts Vader in a lightsaber duel. At the climactic moment in the duel, after telling Vader \"if you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine,\" and just as Luke and the others are making a run for the Falcon, Obi-Wan allows Vader to strike him down, and his body vanishes as becomes one with the Force. In the ensuing confusion, Luke hears Obi-Wan's voice instructing him to \"run, Luke, run!\" and the group makes their escape aboard the Falcon.During the film's climactic battle, Obi-Wan continues to communicate with Luke through the Force, giving him guidance and counsel as Luke destroys the Death Star. The Empire Strikes Back\nIn The Empire Strikes Back, set three years later, Luke is knocked out on the plains of Hoth, and Obi-Wan's force ghost appears telling Luke to go to the Dagobah system for further training with Yoda. After Luke has been trained as a Jedi, Obi-Wan appears in Dagobah to try and dissuade him from going to Cloud City, where Vader holds Han and Leia hostage, as he feels his young apprentice is not yet ready to face Vader one-on-one. After Luke insists on facing Vader, Obi-Wan says sadly that he couldn't help him.Luke is nearly killed in a lightsaber duel with Vader, who reveals to him that he is his father and tries to enlist him into the dark side of the Force. Luke escapes, but is haunted by the truth Obi-Wan withheld from him. Return of the Jedi\nIn Return of the Jedi, set one year later, a dying Yoda confirms to Luke that Vader is indeed his father. After Yoda's death, Obi-Wan appears on Dagobah as a Force Ghost to explain to a heartbroken Luke why he did not tell him the truth about his father, and to confess that Leia was his sister. Obi-Wan admits that his own pride had been partly to blame for Anakin Skywalker's fall from grace: \"I thought I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong.\" He then tries to explain to Luke that killing Vader is the only way to destroy the Empire and save the galaxy, even if it means committing patricide.At the end of the film, Obi-Wan's ghost appears alongside the ghosts of fellow Jedi Yoda and a redeemed Anakin on the forest moon of Endor, watching over Luke and his comrades as they celebrate the destruction of the second Death Star and, with it, the Empire.","Normal people would remember Boba Fett as a guy in a green suit. But for criminals, for those who hang out in wretched hives of scum and villainy, Boba Fett was a terrible nightmare. Fett was one of the most feared bounty hunters in the galaxy. He was so efficient that his employers often had to specify \"No Disintegrations.\"For all intents and purposes, Boba Fett was the last of the Mandalorians who were an ancient race of conquerors. The Mandalorians crafted a form of armor that was almost indestructible and could not be pierced with energy weapons. This, along with cutting edge weaponry, made Boba Fett one of the greatest warriors and bounty hunters in the galaxy.Boba inherited the armor from his father Jango Fett, another famous bounty hunter, who provided the genetic material for the Empire's clone army. Boba changed the color of the armor from blue to green after his father's death at the hands of Mace Windu, a Jedi master on the high council. Windu decapitated his father with a lightsaber and Boba Fett was left holding the head. He also covered his armor with weaponry that included a powerful blaster, a flamethrower and a lot more.His fathers death was precipitated after a Jedi master named Obi Wan Kenobi came to the planet Kamino where his father had been raising him. Kenobi was investigating an assassination attempt on Senator Padme Amidala a former queen to the planet of Naboo. The assassination attempt was linked to Jango Fett who was a notorious bounty hunter.A fight between Kenobi and Jango Fett ensued. His father albeit clever was outmatched but Boba Fett was able to pin down the Jedi master with a laser barrage from his fathers ship, Slave 1. The Fetts then left Kamino and fled to the droid factory located on the planet Geonosis. From there, they met up with the Sith Lord Count Dooku who had captured a pair of Jedi and Padme Amidala.Boba Fett's father was killed after a clone army led by Jedi arrived on the planet to rescue the captive Jedi. A battle took place between a clone army led by the Jedi and the Droids led by Count Dooku. During the battle, Jango Fett killed several Jedi but was ultimately decapitated by Mace Windu.Boba Fett grew up and followed in his fathers footsteps. He became one of the most feared and ruthless bounty hunters in galaxy. He worked for both the Empire under Darth Vader and the criminal underworld under Jabba the Hutt. He wore several braids of his victims attached to his shoulders as a testament to his killing ability.His greatest prize came after Darth Vader hired him to track down the Millennium Falcon piloted by one of his bounties, Han Solo. His mission was to capture Solo along with Chewbacca the Wookie and Princess Leia. Vader hoped to use them to lure his son, Luke Skywalker to Cloud City.Boba Fett followed the Millennium Falcon after it detached itself from the Star Destroyer. Fett had a hunch that Solo would attempt to escape after the Star Destroyer jettisoned its garbage and float away with the rest of the junk. Unfortunately for Luke Skywalker's friends, Boba Fett was wise to Solo's plan.Fett tracked the Falcon to Cloud City, located on the planet Bespin. There, Vader and Fett manipulated Captain Solo's associate and operator of the gas mine, Lando Calrissian, into aiding them in the capture of Solo and his friends. Han Solo was eventually encased in carbonite and taken to Jabba the Hutt inside the ship Boba inherited from his father.After a failed attempt to rescue Han Solo, Solo was sentenced to death via the Sarlacc Pit along with Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca the Wookie. Unfortunately for Jabba the Hutt and the execution party, Lando Calrissian and a pair of droids who were faithful to Skywalker had infiltrated Jabba's palace. Luke Skywalker then began a fresh attempt to rescue his friends from a horrible and certain death.While Boba Fett took aim at Luke Skywalker with his blaster, a blind Han Solo accidentally hit the jump servos on Fetts rocket-pack with a vibro-axe. The out of control Fett flew threw the air and crashed against the side of Jabbas sail barge before falling into the Pit of Sarlacc. With a burp the galaxys most notorious bounty hunter was lost forever. (Or was he?)","Lobot was the chief administrative aide to Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian on Cloud City over the planet Bespin. His brain was connected to the city's central computer which allowed him to communicate directly with the city's computer network. In this capacity, he served as the city's first and only computer-liaison officer.","null","null","Palpatine, also known by his Sith name Darth Sidious, is the central villain of the Star Wars saga. He appears in every film except the first.\n\n\nContents [hideshow]\n\n1.1. The Phantom Menace\n1.2. Attack of the Clones\n1.3. Revenge of the Sith\n1.4. A New Hope\n1.5. The Empire Strikes Back\n1.6. Return of the Jedi\n\nThe Phantom MenacePalpatine represents the small, outer-rim planet Naboo in the Galactic Senate. As Darth Sidious, he arrages for the Trade Federation to invade Naboo, knowing that procedural red tape in the Senate will prevent Supreme Cancellor Valorum from taking any action on the invasion. His plan is to use this failure to act to discredit Valorum in the Senate, and elevate himself to the Chancellorship. Valorum sends two Jedi Knights, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, to Naboo. They end up rescuing Naboo's leader, Queen Amidala, and escorting her to Naboo. Though this was not part of Palpatine's plan, he quickly takes advantage of the situation, manipulating her into calling for Valorum's removal. As expected, being from Naboo himself gains him a sympathy vote, and he is elected Chancellor.During the Battle of Naboo, Palpatine's apprentice, Darth Maul, kills Qui-Gon Jinn but is himself killed by Obi-Wan Kenobi. Palpatine quickly sets his sights, however, on Kenobi's new apprentice: Anakin Skywalker, whom the Jedi believe to be a prophecied Chosen One who will destroy the Sith.Attack of the ClonesTen years later, Anakin Skywalker has grown into a young adult, and Palpatine has maintained a relationship with him for some time. As Chancellor, he is forced to deal with a separatist movement led by former Jedi Count Dooku, who years before had been Qui-Gon Jinn's mentor.Secretly, Count Dooku was in fact Sidious's next apprentice, Darth Tyranus. Sidious planned to use this separatist movement to create a war, and use the war as a pretext to gain more executive power and have his own private army of Clones. The outbreak of the Clone War at the climax of this episode gives Palpatine the power he wants.Revenge of the SithPalpatine arranges for himself to be kidnapped by Count Dooku and General Greivous, laying a trap for Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who come to rescue him. Unbeknownst to all but himself, Palpatine intends to use this incident not only to test Anakin's willingness to use the Dark Side, but also to rid himself of Count Dooku. After Anakin disarms Dooku (literally), Palpatine convinces him to kill Dooku. His willingness to do this proves to Palpatine that he is an ideal Sith apprentice.He spends the next several days grooming Anakin, convincing him that turning to the Dark Side will allow him to save his wife from death in childbirth, and that having a Sith Lord in charge of the galaxy will bring stability. Anakin resists at first, informing the Jedi that Palpatine is a Sith, but later relents, and ends up helping Palpatine kill Mace Windu. In the fight, Palpatine is permanently disfigured. Palpatine accepts Anakin as his apprentice and renames him Darth Vader. He sends Vader to kill all the Separatists, and at the next session of the Senate, declares himself Emperor. Yoda confronts him in the Senate, and the two engage in an epic duel, but it ends in a stalemate, with Yoda going into exhile. Palpatine must then travel to Mustafar to rescue Vader, who has been seriously injured in a duel with Obi-Wan Kenobi. To keep his apprentice alive, Palpatine has him encased on a robotic body and suit.A New HopePalpatine is not seen in this film, but we learn that he has disbanded the Imperial Senate, the last remaining aspect of the Republic's government.The Empire Strikes BackPalpatine appears only in holographic form in this episode. He warns Vader of the threat posed by Luke Skywalker, but Vader suggests turning him to the Dark Side, to which Palpatine agrees.Return of the JediPalpatine finally returns in the flesh in this episode, arriving over Endor to oversee the final stages of the construction of the second Death Star, and to witness the destruction of the alliance. As expected, the Rebel Alliance sends a strike force to Endor to deactivate a shield generator that is protecting the Death Star. When Vader tells him that Luke is with them, he instructs him to bring Luke to him so that they can finish converting him to the Dark Side.Luke is much more resistant to turning than his father was. After being goaded by Palpatine for some time, he finally attempts to kill Palpatine, but Vader comes to his defense, and father and son engage in a lightsaber duel. Luke finally disarms his father, at which point Palpatine urges him to kill his father and become his next apprentice. Unlike his father, Luke refuses, so Palpatine attacks him with Force Lightning, torturing and nearly killing him. Seeing his son nearly dying at his master's hand, however, reawakens the humanity in Vader, and he hurls Palpatine into the Death Star's main reactor. This kills Palpatine, and fulfills the prophecy that he had spent a lifetime trying to prevent. Unfortunately, Palpatine turns his lightning on Vader, shorting out the circuits in his robotic body and mortally wounding him. Vader accepts his fate, however, and asks Luke to remove his mask so he can see his son naturally. He takes one first and last look at Luke, then dies as Anakin Skywalker."],"ImageURL":["http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTMxNTgwMTYxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjczMTY2Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY425_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNDMxMzIwMDk4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTczMTY2Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY428_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTI4NzI0MzIyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTgzMTY2Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY952_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjI3MjA0NTQwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzcxMTY2Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY977_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjIyOTMyNTg2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTg1NjI4NA@@._V1._SX640_SY862_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjE2MjY3MjQzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzAyMzA4NA@@._V1._SX640_SY958_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTM2OTkwOTAyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEyMTIyMw@@._V1._SX640_SY962_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTI5MTc3MTAzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzIyMTIyMw@@._V1._SX640_SY646_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNDIwNjM4Nzk0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDcxMTY2Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY951_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjE4OTg0ODAxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjkxMTIyMw@@._V1._SX640_SY432_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTkxMjM0NzQzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDczMTY2Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY428_.jpg","null","null","null","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTg0MDgxODY3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODkxMzA4NA@@._V1._SX640_SY427_.jpg"],"Name":["Luke Skywalker","Han Solo","Princess Leia","Lando Calrissian","C-3PO","Darth Vader","Chewbacca","R2-D2","Yoda\n\n                (voice)","Ben 'Obi-wan' Kenobi","Boba Fett","Lando's Aide","Chief Ugnaught","Snow Creature","Emperor\n\n                (voice)"]},"10":{"Actor":[],"Bio":[],"ImageURL":[],"Name":[]}},"Link":"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0080684\/","Title":"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"},{"Characters":{"0":{"Actor":["Michael Berryman","Peter Brocco","Dean R.

Using the deep malice that dwelt in his heart, Sauron did just that. From his age old desire to rule all of Middle-Earth and shape it in his own image, Sauron attempted to taint 19 rings made in Eregion (which he bestowed as gifts with the ability to govern each race) for the most powerful of the world's inhabitants so that he could work his will through them. 3 were given to Elves (Nenya, the ring of water, to Giladriel, Narya, the ring of fire, to Cerdan the Shipright, and Vilya, the ring of the wind, to Elrond). Sauron was unsuccessful in tainting these rings, in no small part due to the wisdom of the elves (who did not use them and bore them to the undying lands when their powers had faded). 7 rings were given to the Dwarf Lords and 9 to the race of Men. The Dwarven rings, save one, were captured by Sauron and tainted, though no effect on Dwarves could be detected other than intensifying their treasure lust and greed (another great frustration to Sauron). The nine given to men, however, easily metastasized their desire for power into blood-lust and war. The nine kings and sorcerers would later become Sauron's deadliest servants, the Nazgul. However, the One Ring he forged in the Fires of Mount Doom (the one place it could be destroyed). It was cast with one purpose; to give Sauron rule over all.. Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,\nSeven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,\nNine for Mortal Men doomed to die,\nOne for the Dark Lord on his dark throne,\nIn the land of Mordor where the shadows lie.\nOne Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,\nOne Ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them,\nIn the land of Mordor where the shadows lie\nAfter the War of the Last Alliance, Sauron's physical embodiment was destroyed, but the ring was allowed to endure for a short time with Isildur (the son of the fallen King of Men, Elendil). Sauron's essence and soul were bound to the ring, it became its own force in Middle Earth, and it betrayed Isildur to his death. Hence it received one of its many names, Isildur's bane. It passed out of all knowledge for 2500 years until it was picked up by an ancestor of the Hobbit, a small river dweller named Deagol. The Ring quickly went to work and inspired Smeagol to murder his friend Deagol and take possession of the Ring. He was to be its keeper, poisoned for 500 years until the only name he knew was Gollum and it abandoned him for a way out of the dark caverns of the misty mountains. Bilbo Baggins retrieved it by accident but found that it came in handy in making him an invisible burglar when he finally reached the lonely mountain. After his encounter with Smaug, the dragon, Bilbo kept the ring in the Shire for 60 years until both Sauron (through torturing Gollum) and Gandalf became aware that Bilbo had the Ring. Sauron dipatched his Nazgul and Gandalf started Frodo on his quest to destroy it. The impervious ring, unable to be destroyed by any craft other than the mountain of fire itself, was Sauron's lifeline, his one way to continue to work evil in the world and the Ring's power lay in its ability to influence people and take advantage of their weaknesses, a testament to those who resisted and peril to those who gave in. \"They are one, the Dark Lord and the Ring,\" \"It has no other master.\"null","Frodo Baggins is a Hobbit of the Shire, born on September 22nd in the year 2968 (1368 Shire Reckoning) of the Third Age of Middle-earth (using J.R.R. Tolkien's literary timeline). In 2980, following the deaths of his parents Drogo and Primula Baggins, Frodo is adopted by his older cousin Bilbo and is named as his heir. On September 22nd, 3001, \"Uncle\" Bilbo gave a huge party to celebrate his 111st birthday and Frodo's 33rd (marking Frodo's coming-of-age as an adult).Hobbits are much like Men, but shorter (averaging between 2 and 3 feet tall) and somewhat more long-lived (90 to 100 years). Hobbits have hairy, almost furry, feet with tough, leathery soles. They tend to prefer to lead quiet, uneventful lives.Although not well-known inside the Shire, Frodo is legendary elsewhere in Middle Earth for his task in destroying the One Ring of power, and thus destroying the evil lord Sauron in the process. Accompanied by his friend and gardner Samwise Gamgee (along with as many as eight others at several points), Frodo took the long trek from the Shire to Mount Doom in Mordor. During the course of their quest, The Fellowship of The Ring encountered many attacks from external and internal forces, most notably from Gollum, who possessed the One Ring before Bilbo Baggins picked it up and subsequently gave it to Frodo.Although Frodo survived his journey to Mordor, during the trek he was wounded by the sword of the Witch King. The wound never fully healed and left Frodo unable to settle back into his life in the Shire. Because they were both Ring bearers, Frodo and Bilbo were afforded the special honor of sailing west with the elves to the Grey Havens. There, their adventures in Middle Earth ended.","null","Samwise Gamgee is a hobbit, Frodo Baggins's gardener and his companion on his journey to Mount Doom. When Gandalf comes to the Shire to tell Frodo the truth about the ring he inherited from his uncle Bilbo, he catches Sam eavesdropping, and orders him to go with Frodo on his journey. They are joined en route to Rivendell by Meriadoc \"Merry\" Brandybuck and Peregrin \"Pippin\" Took, two of Frodo's cousins, and Strider, a D\u00fanedain ranger of the North. At Rivendell, Frodo volunteers to take the Ring to Mount Doom to destroy it, and Sam volunteers to go with him. They are joined by the other hobbits and Strider, now revealed as Aragorn, last heir to the throne of Gondor, along with Gandalf, Gimli the Dward, Legolas the Elf, and Boromir, a man from Gondor, elder son of the Steward, Denethor II.Frodo ultimately decides that he must leave the Fellowship behind and continue on his own, but Sam insists on going with him. They soon capture Gollum and force him to act as their guide, though Sam is always suspicious of the wretched creature. His fears are later vindicated when Gollum leads Frodo into the lair of Shelob, a giant spider, hoping that Frodo will be killed and he could then take the Ring.Sam saves Frodo from Shelob, but Frodo has been stung by Shelob, and it appears to Sam as if he is dead. Later, when Orcs approach, Sam takes the Ring, and intends to go on alone, and complete the mission given to Frodo. However, he overhears the Orcs talking and discovers that Frodo isn't dead, simply paralyzed by Shelob's poison. The Orcs take Frodo to the tower of Cirith Ungol on the western border of Mordor, Sam following all the way. Sam rescues Frodo from the Orcs and returns the Ring to him, and they travel toward Mount Doom once again.Frodo grows progressively weaker under the influence of the Ring, and Sam's help is essential in getting him through Mordor to Mount Doom, once physically carrying him up the mountain until attacked by Gollum. There Frodo goes on alone, as Sam fends off Gollum. After seemingly defeating Gollum, he follows Frodo, urging him to throw the Ring into the fire, a scene shockingly similar to that which had happened 3000 years before, when Elrond told Isildur to destroy the Ring. Frodo decides to keep the Ring, and as he puts it on Sam is knocked out by Gollum, who then attacks Frodo, in a desperate fight to the death over possession of the ring. Sam watches the fight between them, until Frodo and Gollum topple over the precipice. Sam rescues Frodo, but Gollum and the ring perish in the volcano.At the end, Sam returned to the Shire, and married the one that he loved, Rosie Cotton, and they had many children: Elanor (named after the flower in Lorien), Goldilocks, Frodo, Pippin, Merry, Hamfast, Rose, and others. He continued to look after Frodo, particularly on the two days of year where he always fell ill, the day on which the ring perished, and the day on which he was pierced by the Morgul blade, until Frodo left for Valinor. He always felt somewhat guilty for his fame in Hobbiton, for he, Merry, and Pippin were hailed as heroes for saving the Shire from the \"Boss\", \"Sharkey\" aka Saruman, who had taken over the Shire. He felt Frodo deserved fame much more than he, but Frodo liked the anonymity.Sam was mayor of Hobbiton for many years. When Rosie died, he took a ship to Valinor (the Undying Lands), as he was himself a ring-bearer for a short while.","Originally a Maia of Aul\u00eb's people, Sauron was early corrupted by Melkor and became his most trusted lieutenant.His treason was not discovered for some time, however, nor was it discovered by any will other than his own. For in cunning, few if any, within the mortal realm were his match. Prior to his overt defection, he served as a spy of Melkor, through the destruction of Almaren until his open defection from the Blessed Realm of Valinor.Once wholly in the service of Melkor, he was known as Gorthaur the Cruel, a necromancer of terrible power. Able to perceive the mind of Melkor like no other, he was true to his master and sought not to advance himself while in his service. Such was the relationship, that Gorthaur had a share in all the malice and works of evil wrought by Melkor in those days, and he was named as chief lieutenant of Melkor, and made master of the newly delved fortress of Angband.After the first war of the Valar against Melkor, when Melkor was chained and doomed to wait in the fastness of the Halls of Mandos for 3 ages, Sauron was not found by the Valar. He eluded their capture and remained hidden in Middle Earth, breeding the hideous race of the Orcs into a vast army during this time.Sauron was directly involved in the Tale of Beren and Luthien, imprisoning Beren and ultimately losing control of Angband to Luthien after being defeated in solo combat by Huan, the mightiest hound to ever live.So weakened was he from the combat he lost the ability to change his form and faded from sight for a period of time. It was just as well for him, as at this time the War Of Wrath was undertaken by the Valar and their hosts against Morgoth.The destruction wrought by these battles was so great that the land was broken and Middle Earth was reshaped, seas spilled, mountains tumbled and new lands were created. With the final and complete downfall of Morgoth, Sauron was stunned, and sought the pardon of Eonwe, a Maiar like himself... Called to accept the Judgment of Manwe, Sauron was prideful, and ashamed, and went forth and hid in Middle Earth, forsaking the last chance he had to return to the places and ways of the holy realm.This event marked the turning from the First Age to the Second.The War of Wrath had visited so much destruction upon Middle Earth, the Valar feared to mar it any further, for the sake of the Children of Eru Il\u00favatar. As such they decreed a 'hands off' approach to dealing with further problems concerning middle earth, and Sauron used this to great advantage. Declaring that the Valar had 'forsaken' Middle Earth, he feigned pity on its inhabitants, and assumed the masquerade of a benevolent benefactor.In fair guise and semblance, and using the name \"Annatar\", he visited the kingdoms on the world. Ever offering friendship and council, those who heeded his words had much profit of his vast and immeasurable knowledge. Instructions he gave, on how Rings of Power might be fashioned, and through these rings the power and authority of the wearer might be greatly enhanced. Life could be extended, seemingly indefinitely, to the mortal men of the world, a matter near to their hearts.By the greatest of the Elven Smiths, the Three Great Rings, were fashioned. Narya, Nenya and Vilya.Being devised by the great, they were made independently of Sauron's direct aid. As such, they were unsullied by the curses laid upon the rings he had a hand in making. But being devised by his knowledge and teachings, they were still subordinate to the One Ring he later made. Without the curses, their owners were able to perceive Sauron's mind and malice, and were free to take their rings off. This may well have proved the Achilles Heel of his designs.The rings in which Sauron directly aided in the construction of were perilous, and contained hidden traps, wrought into them by Sauron to ensnare their owners. As they were worn, they slowly broke the will of, and addicted their users. Inspiring in them the greed, malice and hatred for living things felt by the rings creator, and enslaving them to his will.When the keepers of The Three perceived Sauron's intentions, they defied him by removing their rings. Sauron perceived his peril, and knew that with his fair semblance in ruins, he should never again have the opportunity to conquer via subversion. Thus it was that he openly declared war upon Middle Earth.After the War of Wrath, the Valar had prepared an island home for the Edain, the faithful men who had stayed true to the Elves during the wars against Morgoth. For centuries, the Edain, who were blessed among men by their associations with the Valar during the war, had lived on this Island of Numenor. They had become Mighty, living for nearly a thousand years, the greatest of mariners, and truly more adept in craft and skill than any other men, eclipsing even the lesser orders of the Elves, those who had never been to Valinor.Yet they were still mortal...As Sauron's new war raged upon MIddle Earth, all were hard pressed, for long in secret places in his fortress in Mordor, had his armies been conceived. Now they burst upon the beleaguered inhabitants, who were short of leaders, or whose leaders were already secretly under the power of Sauron, by virtue of their possession of the cursed rings.Sauron's victory was nigh at hand, when suddenly, out of the West, appeared the ships of the Numenorians.Even the least among these men were as great kings of men, and they had the light of Aman in their faces, for they had beheld the Valar, and the Blessed Realm, even from afar, though they were forbidden to enter it as mortals.Sauron's servants fell like cord wood before their wroth, and quailed in their presence, and would throw down their arms, taking to flight. Yet the Sea Kings, at first, troubled him little... They stayed near the coast, teaching and benefiting the lesser men, and taking little heed of his works outside their coastal sphere of influence...Thus it came to pass that Sauron dominated most of Middle Earth, and proclaimed himself \"King of Middle Earth\".This fact was of particular interest to the actual King of Men, a title granted by Manwe, to the King of the Numenorians, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n.He resolved through pride to humble this upstart 'king', and sent an army against Sauron. Faced with the military might of Numenor, Sauron stood amazed.Under protection of the Valar, men now fielded an army mightier than even those of Morgoth. Seeing the utter futility of force of arms against this massive force, Sauron disbanded his armies, sent them into hiding, concealed his ring, (which is to say concealed it from the sight of men, he did not cease to possess it), and subjected himself as prisoner to Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n.Yet as ever, Sauron's true devices were always other than they seemed...Within 1000 years of his arrival in Numenor as the prisoner of Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n, Sauron had worked his way from prisoner, to adviser, to counselor, eventually all the way up to priest \/ spiritual adviser of the entire realm, corrupting it, and corrupting the men of Numenor. Some few who resisted his corruptions found themselves at odds with the king, and were slain, or cruelly put to death in ritual sacrifices to Melkor...Shortly thereafter, by Sauron's design, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n was moved to war against the Valar... Once again, the level of Sauron's success through cunning was so complete that it proved his undoing.For in their dismay at the rising of the Numenorians against them, the Valar, for that time, forsook the stewardship of Earth, turning it over to Eru Il\u00favatar, who, in his wrath, opened up the earth to swallow the Isle of Numenor. All of the Island, and all the grand fleet of Numenor, save the tip of the holy mountain, were swallowed up. The few faithful men of Numenor who had refused to participate in the war, and had prepared ships to depart the island were blown wildly across the ocean, to the shores of middle Earth.Among these were Elendil, An\u00e1rion and Isildur... They established the Kingdoms in Middle Earth, Arnor in the north and Gondor in the south.At the overthrow of Numenor, Sauron was washed into the Abyss, along with all of the corruption he had spawned among the Numenorians. His body was destroyed, and he forsook it. Eventually, his spirit returned to his fastness in Mordor, where he again wielded his ring, and returned to his former power. Now deeming himself strong against the few Men of Numenor remaining, he made war once again.(This presents one of several ambiguities or dichotomies in Tolkien's tales, wherein the body of Sauron was destroyed, and his spirit fled, yet somehow the ring fled with the spirit, as Tolkien was emphatic that Sauron in a housed body was inseparable from the One Ring)In that time, The Last Alliance of Elves and Men was made. Under the organized efforts of Gil-Galad, the elven king of Lindon, and Elendil, the high-king of Arnor and Gondor, the lesser societies of elves and men were unified under one banner. A great victory was won on the plains of Dagorlad, and Mordor was successfully invaded. The Siege of Barad-Dur lasted 7 Years.At the end, Sauron was so pressed that he was forced to come forth to combat himself. He stood, mighty, dark and terrible before the assembled armies, a demon now, rather than an angel, and with the power and might of the Maiar, did combat with elves and men. Such was his power that none might overthrow him. Gil-Galad and Elendil, both kings, were slain by his prowess in combat. Gil-Galad from the heat of his hands, and Elendil crushed by his mace... Yet as Sauron stretched forth his hand to take up and destroy Isildur, once again the magnitude of the folly of his own designs revealed itself...For by virtue of investing so much of his power into the One Ring, when Isildur, in desperation, grabbed the broken hilt of Elendil's sword and hewed at the outstretched hand, as the ring fell free, Saurons power was dispersed... Knowing his peril, he again forsook his body and his spirit fled to unknown regions.Yet he remained. For when Isildur refused the councils of Cirdan and Elrond to destroy the ring in the fires of Mt. Doom, he set about a course of events that would lead to his own downfall and all the subsequent evils.After the Fall of Sauron, the kingdom of Arnor was hard pressed, their king and much of their army had been destroyed in the Last Alliance... Internal strife sapped much of what should have been a unified effort... After the death of Elendil, Isildur claimed lordship over the realm. However, on his return to Arnor the ring betrayed him. He was felled by orc arrows and the One Ring vanished from sight, for a time. Eventually, his descendants in Arnor would face a new and terrible enemy, The Witch-King of Angmar.Eventually, the kingship fell to E\u00e4rendur, who divided it among his three sons, seeking to alleviate internal strife. In the end, this only made matters worse, and eventually the entire northern kingdom fell before aid could arrive from Gondor. The former lords of the realm became the Dunedain Rangers, and made guerrilla war upon the northern marches.The Witch King of Angmar, a great lord of Numenor, corrupted to Sauron's will by one of the rings of power, and later known as the Lord of the Nazgul, and Black Captain, chief of the Ringwraiths, ordered the war against Arnor in the north. After the arrival of the armies of Gondor and his defeat by them, the Witch-King fled into the northern regions, and E\u00e4rnur, wanting to pursue him, was famously told by Glorfindel, \"Do not pursue him! He will not return to these lands. Far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man will he fall.\".. And thus the prophecy of his eventual demise was wrought.In the absence of Sauron's forces, Middle Earth was blessed with 1000 years of relative peace and tranquility... However, the remnant spirits of Morgoth still roamed the world, Dragon, Balrog, and orcs, and lacking leadership, they turned to their own governance. Then, after the 1000 years had passed, the forest of Greenwood the Great fell dark... The Wise took council and determined the cause to be the Necromancer of Dol Guldor.......This was in fact, Sauron, taking shape again.The Valar, once again perceiving the imminent fall of the children to the subjugation of darkness, took council. Being still under their oath never again to directly make war upon Middle Earth, they sent forth the Istari, the \"Wizards\"... Other members of the order of the Maiar, forbidden from revealing themselves in true power or majesty... To bring the children to victory only through their wise councils.The Istari were:Curunir, (Saruman the White)\nOlorin, (Gandalf the Grey)\nRadagast, (the Brown)\nThe Blue Wizards (According to Unfinished Tales their names are Alatar and Pallando)By the efforts of the wizards, and their council, The Necromancer of Dol Guldor (Sauron) was driven out of southern Mirkwood, and he fled to his old fastness of Mordor. Sauron is also deprived, during this time, of 2 extremely powerful weapons he would otherwise have had at his disposal... The dragon Smaug the Golden, dispatched by the Dwarves, Bilbo, and more directly, Bard of Dale; as well as, eventually, the Balrog of Morgoth in Moria, known as Durin's Bane, dispatched by Gandalf himself.One may only speculate as to the chaos which would have followed the appearance of these two entities on the Battlefield of Gondor later in the tale...Nonetheless, Sauron, gaining strength, recalled such servants as were available to him, orcs, trolls, evil men, and most especially, the Ringwraiths, his most terrible servants, and renewed the search for his ring.After corrupting the head of the White Council, (Saruman), through the use of a Palantir, Sauron does not take any more significant direct action in the tale; being bereft of body until the uttermost end. When, by the council of Gandalf, now The White; Samwise Gamgee and Frodo Baggins ultimately succeed, (even against themselves), in destroying the One Ring through the treachery of Smeagol Gollum .Such was the power of the One Ring, with so much of his own hate and malice bound up within it, that at its destruction, Sauron's spirit dispersed, never to be able to metastasize again.","Boromir is the older son of Denethor II, Steward of Gondor, and older brother to Faramir. He first appears in The Fellowship of the Ring, at the Council of Elrond.As Sauron first begins to regain power in Middle-Earth, he also began attempting to invade Gondor. First, he had to break through the defenses of Osgiliath, a city on the Anduin River that separated Gondor from Mordor. Boromir and Faramir had successfully driven the enemy back when their father, Denethor, arrived, to tell Boromir that Elrond had summoned a council, without stating its purpose. Denethor, however, had deduced that the One Ring had been found. This coincided with a dream Boromir himself had had regarding Rivendell. Despite his own reluctance to leave his people behind, Boromir travelled to Rivendell at his father's request, and with orders to bring the Ring back to Gondor to help defend his country.At the council, however, he found himself alone in his mentality that the Ring could be used against Sauron. All the others agreed that the only way to defeat Sauron was to take the Ring to Mordor where it could be destroyed by casting it into Mount Doom. Frodo Baggins volunteered to take the Ring, and Boromir was among those whosen to accompany him. The others included the wizard Gandalf, the Ranger Aragorn, Gimli the dwarf, Legolas the elf, and three other hobbits: Sam Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took.The Fellowship faced many challenges while journeying to Mordor. At first, Gandalf tried to lead them sound along the Misty Mountains, but a flock of Crebain sent from the south to spy on them alerted Gandalf to the fact that Saruman was spying on them. He decided instead to go east over the mountains to avoid Saruman's spies. However, Saruman used his powers to hit the Fellowship with a blizzard, blocking the passage. Boromir proved himself useful in making parths through the snow and protecting the hobbits from the elements.With this road blocked to them, Gandalf instead lead them through Moria. Boromir also helped to defend the Fellowship against an onslaught of Orcs that attacked them during their passage. After Gandalf fell into the abyss under the bridge of Khazad-Dum, Aragorn assumed leadership of the Fellowship, and took them to Lothlorien.In Lothlorien, he became distraught over the fate of Gondor, and began to think that he would have to decide soon whether to take the Ring from Frodo, or continue to help him into Moria. After leaving Lothlorien, the Fellowship travelled in boats down the River Anduin, making camp on the western side of the Emyn Muil mountain range. There, Frodo snuck away from the Fellowship, but Boromir followed him, and made a last-minute attempt to get the Ring from Frodo, first by persuasion, and then by force. Frodo put on the Ring and escaped from Boromir, intending to go on alone. He was spotted by Merry and Pippin, who rather than try to stop him from leaving, helped by distracting an army of Orcs thathad just overtaken their camp site. Frodo managed to escape, but Merry and Pippin were outnumbered. A repentant Boromir came to their aid, successfully defending them from many Orcs, but even he was ounumbered. The leader of the Orcs, Lurtz, fired three arrows into Boromir, fatally wounding him, as the other Orcs took Merry and Pippin captive.Aragorn arrived soon after and killed Lurtz, but it was too late for Boromir. He expressed his remorse for trying to take the Ring from Frodo, and gave Aragorn--the rightful heir of Gondor--his blessing to be King, and then died. The remaining members of the Fellowship; Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas; placed Boromir's corpse in on of their boats and pushed him out into the River Anduin.Afterwards, his funeral boat was found by his brother, Faramir, who also took his broken horn and delivered it to their father, Denethor.","Noldorin princess, the daughter of Finarfin. Galadriel was the only woman to play a prominent role in the debate of the Noldor following the theft of the Silmarils, and, eager to return to Middle-earth, she was one of the leaders of the host of Fingolfin.In Middle-earth she dwealt with Finrod on Tol Sirion, but when her brother moved to Nargothrond, she went to Doriath, where she married Celeborn and was instructed in wisdom by Melian. She had one child, Celebrian. At the fall of Doriath she probably fled to Arvernien or the Mouths of Sirion. Galadriel was the only leader of the revolting Noldor to survive the Wars of Beleriand, and at the end of the First Age a ban was set on her return to Valinor.In the Second Age, Galadriel dwelt for a time in Lindon and Eregion, and then founded and became Queen of Lorien, which she made on the model of Doriath and the Girdle of Melian and sustained with the aid of her own power and that of Nenya, one of the Three Rings, which was given to her at its making. Throughout the Second and Third Ages Lorien remained safe from Sauron, for Galadriel's power was such that she knew his mind but hers was closed to him, and she could protect Lorien from assault by any power less than Sauron himself.During the War of the Ring, Galadriel gave shelter and great gifts to the Companions of the Ring, and she refused the One Ring when it was offered to her by Frodo. Because of this, and because of her endless opposition to Sauron, at the end of the Third Age the Valr permitted her to return to Valinor. Galadriel fulfilled her age-old desire in Third Age 3021, when she went over Sea with the Last Riding of the Keepers of the Rings.Galadriel was very tall and the greatest beauty of the house of Finwe; she had the golden hair of her mother's kindred.","Sindarin Elf of the Woodland Realm, son of Thranduil. In Third Age 3019 Legolas went to Rivendell as a messenger and took part in the Council of Elrond. He then became one of the Companions of the Ring, representing the Elves. In Lorien Legolas became very friendly with Gimli, a friendship which was maintained for the rest of their lives. After the breaking of the Fellowship, Legolas went with Aragorn and Gimli in search of Merry and Pippin, and they fought in the Battle of the Hornburg at Helm's Deep. He was one of the Grey Company, and fought in the Battle of Pelennor Fields. While in Southern Gondor Legolas for the first time saw the Sea, and the Eldarin yearning for Eldemar was awakened in him.After the War of the Ring Legolas led a number of Elves of the Woodland Realm to Ithilien, where they beautified the war ravaged land. In Fourth Age 120, after the death of Elessar, Legolas finally sailed over Sea, taking Gimli with him.","Peregrin Took (nicknamed 'Pippin\") is a Took and that should be description enough. Tooks dwell in the Shire in Tookborough. They're set apart from the rest of Hobbits because of their inquisitiveness and adventuresome spirit. Pippin journeys with Frodo to Rivendell and becomes a member of the Fellowship of the Ring. He and his cousin Meriadoc (called \"Merry\") are later separated from the rest of the Fellowship by an attack at Parth Gallen where Boromir of Gondor falls trying to protect them. Pippin and Merry are then carried away by Orcs under the command of Saruman to bring any halflings to Isengard. He and the Fellowship are not fully reunited again (excluding Boromir of course) until the end of the trilogy.In the third part of the trilogy Pippins swears an oath to Lord Denethor II, the steward of Gondor. He does this out of guilt for the death of Boromir, Denethor's first and favorite son. He is later released from his oath when Denethor, believing his second son, Faramir, to be dead, tries to burn both himself and Faramir alive. Pippin knows that Faramir is alive and calls Gandalf for help. When Aragorn takes the throne, Pippin is brought under oath again and he fights in the Battle of Mordor as a knight of Gondor.Pippin and Merry were known for being troublemakers in the Shire. But when they returned, they (along with their cousin Frodo and friend Sam) became heroes after leading the rebellion against Saruman, who had taken over the Shire in their absence. Pippin married Diamond of Long Cleeve, when she was 32 and he was 37. They had one son, Faramir. Faramir Took later married Samwise Gamgee's daughter Goldilocks. He and Merry became the two tallest Hobbits in their history, having drank Ent-draught. Pippin inherited his father's title and became 32nd Thain of the Shire, a position he held for 50 years before retiring and revisiting Rohan and Gondor with Merry. He remained in Gondor for the rest of his life.","Celeborn is the Lord of Lothl\u00f3rien and the husband of Lady GaladrielHe has a daughter with Galadriel named Celebrian, who married Lord Elrond. Thus making him grandfather to Elladan, Elrohir and Arwen.Supposedly the wisest elf in Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age. Celeborn remained in Middle-earth for a time when the rest of the elves departed, but eventually he joined his wife in the Undying Lands.\nIt is said that \"with him went the last living memory of the Elder Days in Middle-earth.\"null","null","null","null","Bilbo Baggins is a Hobbit of the Shire, born on September 22nd in the year 2890 (1290 Shire Reckoning) of the Third Age of Middle-earth (using J.R.R. Tolkien's literary timeline). In 2941, the Wizard Gandalf enlisted Bilbo as a burglar for Thorin Oakenshield and Company, Dwarves intent on liberating their ancestral treasure from the dragon Smaug. As a consequence of this adventure, Bilbo acquired a magic sword which he named \"Sting\" (more like a dagger to anyone other than a Hobbit) and a magic Ring and returned to his home of Bag End comfortably wealthy.In 2980, following the deaths of his relatives Drogo and Primula Baggins, Bilbo adopted his young cousin Frodo and made him his heir. On September 22nd, 3001 (1401 Shire Reckoning), Bilbo gave a huge party to celebrate his 111st birthday (making him one of the most long-lived Hobbits on record).Hobbits are much like Men, but shorter (averaging between 2 and 3 feet tall) and somewhat more long-lived (90 to 100 years). Hobbits have hairy, almost furry, feet with tough, leathery soles. They tend to prefer to lead quiet, uneventful lives.","Saruman was one of the 5 Istari sent to Middle-Earth to help guide the free peoples of Middle-Earth to victory against Sauron. Saruman usually wore white, and was appointed as head of the White Council. He was known as Curunir (the Cunning) by the elves, and his greatest power was his voice, which always sounded like the voice of reason to any weak-minded listeners.\nSaruman got entrenched in the mythology of the Rings of Power, and learned in the records of Minas Tirith that the Ring had fallen into the Anduin. He sought the power accorded with the ring. As he got caught up in his desire for power, he was ensnared by Sauron using the Palantir of Isengard. Saruman decided to betray his duties, and aid Sauron, though his real intentions were to take the ring for himself and overthrow Sauron, taking all the power for himself.\nHe changed his robes at this point, and was known as Saruman of many colours."],"ImageURL":["http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTc5NTU2NDQ5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDIxMjk2Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY362_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTg5MzEzMDM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTk1MjA3._V1._SX485_SY693_.jpg","null","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTg5MDI4NTUyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM2MTk2Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY428_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTc0Njk5NDQwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTU3NTky._V1._SX450_SY564_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjAxNDM0OTc0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzIxMjk2Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY362_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTI5NzI5MDQ4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDkwMjk2Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY428_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTQxODA3MzE5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk2MTk2Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY424_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTgxNzcxMjQwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM2MTk2Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY437_.jpg","null","null","null","null","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTc4NDgxODQwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTc4MTY0OA@@._V1._SX640_SY480_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTAyMTY3MDY3ODBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDAwMTI5NjM@._V1._SX640_SY431_.jpg"],"Name":["The Ring\n\n                (voice)","Frodo Baggins","Everard Proudfoot","Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee","Sauron","Boromir","Galadriel","Legolas Greenleaf","Peregrin 'Pippin' Took","Celeborn","Mrs. Proudfoot","Gondorian Archivist","Gil-Galad","Bilbo Baggins","Saruman"]},"12":{"Actor":[],"Bio":[],"ImageURL":[],"Name":[]}},"Link":"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0120737\/","Title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"},{"Characters":{"0":{"Actor":["Leonardo DiCaprio","Joseph Gordon-Levitt","Ellen Page","Tom Hardy","Ken Watanabe","Dileep Rao","Cillian Murphy","Tom Berenger","Marion Cotillard","Pete Postlethwaite","Michael Caine","Lukas Haas","Tai-Li Lee","Claire Geare","Magnus Nolan"],"Bio":["Cobb is an extractor - he enters people's dreams, steals their secrets, and sells them to their competitors.

The character was based directly on the real-life gangster Jimmy Burke. Jimmy Conway is first introduced in a narrarration by Henry Hill at the beginning of the film. He was a close associate of mob caporegime Paul \"Paulie\" Cicero (based on Paul Vario). Being of Irish decent, Conway could never become a \"made man\" in the Mafia since he is not full-blooded Italian.Jimmy earns his nickname, \"Jimmy the Gent\", and becomes the closest friend and partner-in-crime of Hill, along with sociopathic gangster Tommy DeVito, played by Joe Pesci (based on Tommy DeSimone). He enjoys hijacking trucks on the freeway. Jimmy is present when Billy Batts comes to the bar, mocking Tommy's youthful duties as a shoe-shine boy:\"Now go home and get your fucking shinebox!\" Tommy, enraged leaves and returns to the bar with a revolver. Tommy (aided by Conway) beat Batts savagely to a pulp, later burying his body.Jimmy organizes the Lufthansa Heist. He grows paranoid when the associates begin buying exotics with the money. Stacks (based on Parnell Steven \"Stacks\" Edwards), is shot multiple times by Tommy in his apartment for not delivering the truck in the right place, Conway also organizes the murder of Morris \"Morrie\" Kessler, (based on Martin Krugman), murdered by Tommy in the car for pestering Jimmy over the loot. The bloodied bodies of Johnny Roastbeef (based on Angelo Sepe) and his wife are found in their cadillac, the bodies of Jo Buddah (based on Louis Cafora), and Frenchy (based on Robert McMahon) are found dead to be discovered by sanitation workers, and Frank \"Frankie\" Carbone is found frozen in a meat-truck. Soon after, Tommy is supposed to become a \"made man\" in the Lucchesse Family, but is instead murdered by the elder members of the Family, Vinnie (based on Thomas Agro) and an unknown mobster, as revenge for killing Billy Batts.Jimmy and Henry are arrested for roughing up a man, but soon released. Henry, after being arrested the second time, this time for drug charges, meets Conway at a diner and considers he and his family are marked for death. Hill enters the Witness Protection Program and testifies against Paulie and Jimmy.Kathy Burke, Jimmy Burke's daughter, allegedly attempted to force the GoodFellas production company to pay $100,000 for permission to use the name 'Burke', so they used Jimmy's mother's maiden name 'Conway' instead.","Henry Hill (born June 11, 1943) is a former Irish-Italian American mobster, Lucchese crime family associate, and FBI informant whose life was immortalized in the book Wiseguy, written by crime reporter Nicholas Pileggi, and the 1990 Martin Scorsese film Goodfellas, in which Hill was played by Ray Liotta. He was the owner of a restaurant called The Suite.Henry Hill grew up in a poor working class family in Brownsville, Brooklyn, then a largely Jewish-Italian neighborhood. His father Henry Sr. was an electrician of Irish descent, and his mother Carmella was of Sicilian descent. Henry and his seven siblings lived in a small house. From an early age he admired the local mafiosi that socialized across the street from his home, which included Paul Vario, a capo in the Lucchese crime family. In his early teens, he began running errands at Vario's cabstand, shoe shine stand, and pizzeria.Hill's first arrest came when he attempted to use a stolen credit card to buy tires at a Texaco gas station. Refusing to say anything to the police, he earned the respect of Lucchese Family associate Jimmy Burke, who saw great potential in young Henry. Hill soon dropped out of high school to devote all his time to working for gangsters. Burke, like Hill, was unable to become a made member of the Mafia due to his Irish ancestry, but the Mafia was happy to have associates of any ethnic background as long as they made money and did not cooperate with the authorities.In 1960, Hill joined the Army and was stationed at Fort Bragg, near Fayetteville, North Carolina, for three years. He was a member of the 82nd Airborne paratrooper unit there, but maintained contact with Vario and his other friends in New York throughout his enlistment. Hill continued to hustle while in the service, selling extra food, loan sharking salary advances to his fellow soldiers, and selling tax-free cigarettes. Before being discharged, Hill spent two months in a military stockade for brawling and stealing a sheriff's car.In 1963, he returned to New York, beginning the most notorious phase of his criminal career. Hill, along with close friends Burke and Tommy DeSimone, and others in Burke's Robert's Lounge crew, hijacked trucks, sold stolen goods, imported and sold untaxed cigarettes, engaged in loan sharking and bookmaking, and planned airport robberies, carrying out the Air France Robbery in 1967 and the huge Lufthansa heist in 1978, as well as committing numerous mob-related murders.In 1965, Hill met his wife, Karen. The two first eloped to North Carolina, and later had a large Jewish wedding, to which most of Hill's gangster friends were invited. After the birth of their two children they rented an apartment in a two-family home in Island Park, New York (1968).Hill was paroled in 1978 along with Verdetto and Salvateri truck hijackers after serving six years of a ten-year prison sentence for extortion. Hill and Burke had severely beaten and pistol-whipped a gambler in Tampa, Florida (Gaspar Ciacco) who owed a union official friends of theirs (Luis and Raul Charbonier) a large gambling debt. Burke was also released on parole around the same time as Hill.While in prison, Hill had made contact with a Pittsburgh drug dealer named Paul Mazzei. Hill had sold drugs while in prison to help support his wife and two children on the outside. After his parole, Vario revealed that he knew about Hill's drug dealing in prison and warned him not to continue with this now that he was out. Vario strongly opposed the trade of drugs in his crew because prison sentences imposed on anyone convicted of drug trafficking were so lengthy that the accused would often become informants in exchange for a lighter sentence. Hill nevertheless started a major interstate drug trafficking operation with Mazzei, the potential to earn large amounts of money being too great to resist.Hill began wholesaling marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and quaaludes, earning enormous amounts of money. After the murders of several of his friends by Burke, following the Lufthansa Heist, and the disappearance of his close friend Tommy DeSimone, who, Hill believed, had been delivered by Vario into the hands of (and murdered by,) the Gambino crime family for killing two made members without permission, he became increasingly paranoid.Hill and Mazzei also set up a point shaving scheme, which was put in place when Mazzei convinced Boston College center Rick Kuhn to participate. Kuhn encouraged teammates to join the scheme, which became a scandal. Hill also claimed to have an NBA referee who worked games at Madison Square Garden during the seventies in his pocket because of the debt the referee had accrued gambling on horse races.In 1980, Hill was arrested on a narcotics trafficking charge, bonded out of jail, and shortly afterwards, was re-arrested as a material witness in the Lufthansa robbery. He became convinced that his former associates planned to have him killed: Vario, for dealing drugs, and Burke, to prevent Hill from implicating him in the Lufthansa robbery. This was confirmed by a surveillance tape played to Hill by federal investigators, in which Burke tells Vario of their need to have Hill \"whacked.\"Hill chose to become an informant to avoid a possible execution by the Mafia. Henry Hill's testimony led to 50 convictions. Jimmy Burke was given 20 years in prison for fixing Boston College basketball games and also later sentenced to life in prison for the murder of scam artist Richard Eaton. Burke died of cancer while serving his life sentence, on April 13, 1996. He was 64.Paul Vario received 4 years for helping Henry Hill obtain a no-show job to get him paroled from prison. Vario was also later sentenced to 10 years in prison for extortion of air freight companies at JFK Airport. He died, aged 73, on November 22, 1988 while in a Texas prison, of respiratory failure.Hill, his wife Karen, and their two children entered the U.S. Marshals' Witness Protection Program, changed their names, and moved to undisclosed locations in Omaha, Nebraska, then Independence, Kentucky, and eventually Redmond, Washington.Hill was arrested in 1987 in Seattle, Washington on narcotics-related charges. In 1989, Hill and his wife Karen were divorced after 25 years of marriage.Hill (along with his wife) was expelled from the witness protection program in the early 1990s.After the Seattle incident, Hill claimed to be clean until he was arrested in North Platte, Nebraska in March 2005. Hill had left his luggage at Lee Bird Field Airport in North Platte, Nebraska containing drug paraphernalia, glass tubes with cocaine and methamphetamine residue.Hill worked for a time as a chef at an Italian restaurant in Nebraska and his spaghetti sauce, Sunday Gravy, was marketed over the internet.Hill battled alcoholism for years, claiming at one point that prison had saved his life. In fall 2006, Hill appeared in a photo shoot along with Ray Liotta for Entertainment Weekly. According to the article, Liotta convinced Hill to enter alcohol rehabilitation.Hill lives in Malibu, California with his fiance Lisa Caserta. They will marry in 2008.Hill opened another restaurant, 'Wiseguys', in West Haven, Connecticut in October 2007.Hill is currently selling his artwork on eBay.Hill is a regular on The Howard Stern Show.","Thomas Anthony \"Two-Gun Tommy\" DeSimone (May 24, 1950 January 14, 1979[1]) was a gangster and associate of the Lucchese crime family in New York. Also known as \"Tommy D\", he was a nephew of Los Angeles mob boss Frank DeSimone. He was married to Angelica \"Cookie\" Spione, but was a constant womanizer whose mistresses included Theresa Ferrara.His relative Rosario DeSimone was the boss over Los Angeles, San Diego and Las Vegas from 1931 until his death in 1946. Tommy's uncle, Frank DeSimone, was a criminal attorney-turned-mobster; \"Uncle Frank\" (as he was known) replaced Jack Dragna in 1957 after the latter's death, becoming the second DeSimone family member to become Los Angeles don. Thomas DeSimone had a sister, Dolores as well as two brothers, Gambino crime family associate Robert DeSimone (imprisoned for life) and Gambino crime family associate Vincent DeSimone (murdered by Tommy Agro in early 1970s). He is related to Rosario, James, and Joseph, Ralph, Phil and Franky DeSimone, all of whom were also mobsters. He is the brother-in-law of mobster Joseph \"The Barber\" Spione.DeSimone worked under Mafia capo Paul Vario with his friends Burke and Henry Hill; DeSimone and Hill had known one another since they were young men, when Burke took them on as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. DeSimone was involved in truck hijacking, dealing stolen property, extortion, fraud, and murder.DeSimone's violent temper was well known. While playing pinochle with Joseph Ianuzzi and Thomas Agro, he started throwing darts at the other players when he started losing. Hill described DeSimone and Burke by saying, \"It didn't take anything for these guys to kill you. They liked it. They would sit around drinking booze and talk about their favorite hits. They enjoyed talking about them.\" Hill later described DeSimone as a \"psychopath\", and suggested that DeSimone had something to prove because his older brother, Anthony, had become an informant and was allegedly murdered by members of the Gambino crime family.DeSimone committed his first murder on March 15, 1968. He was walking down the street with Hill and Burke when DeSimone spotted Howard Goldstein, an innocent person. Hill recalls DeSimone turning to him and saying, \"Hey Henry, watch this.\" DeSimone yelled, \"Hey cocksucker!\", pulled out a .38 caliber pistol, and shot and killed Goldstein. Hill exclaimed, \"That was cold-blooded, Tommy!\" DeSimone replied, \"Well, I'm a mean cat.\"He then killed William \"Billy Batts\" Devino, a made man who was part of the Gambino family. He worked with rising mobster John Gotti. Batts had just gotten out of prison after serving a six-year term for drug possession. While incarcerated, Burke had taken over Batts' businesses, and now that Batts was out of prison, he needed to have Batts out of the way. One night while Batts and Burke were having drinks in The Suite, DeSimone showed up. Recalling the days when DeSimone had shined shoes, Batts began taunting DeSimone by calling him spit-shine Tommy. DeSimone left and later returned with a .38 revolver and a plastic mattress cover. Burke held Batts in a headlock while DeSimone beat his skull with the revolver until it fell apart (according to Hill in The Real GoodFella). DeSimone, Burke, and an unwitting Hill loaded Batts into the trunk of Hill's Buick Riviera, and were on their way to bury him when Batts woke up. He was beaten and stabbed until he eventually died.DeSimone's third murder is described by Hill in his book Wiseguy. A young man named Michael \"Spider\" Gianco was acting as bartender at a card game where DeSimone took out a handgun, and demanded that Gianco dance for him. DeSimone shot him in the foot when Gianco refused. A week later, Gianco was again serving drinks; DeSimone started to bully him about his wounded foot, spurring Gianco to reply \"Why don't you go fuck yourself, Tommy?\" DeSimone lost his temper and shot Gianco in the chest, killing him. Burke and Hill were furious, and made him bury Gianco's body in the cellar.His fourth murder, according to Hill, occurred when DeSimone got carried away after being asked to \"rough up\" a witness to a robbery. After a truck heist, a foreman had refused to allow Burke to unload the cargo of a hijacked truck in his warehouse, and made a tremendous fuss because they had no union cards. Burke attempted to reason with the man, who stood his ground and refused to be intimidated. Burke later sent DeSimone to the man's house in New Jersey, with instructions to threaten and \"rough up\" the man to ensure he would cooperate with Burke in the future. DeSimone, angry for having to drive all the way to New Jersey, ended up beating the man to death.DeSimone killed Gotti prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ronald \"Foxy\" Jerothe on December 18, 1974. DeSimone had dated Jerothe's sister and then beaten her up, prompting Jerothe to threaten to kill DeSimone. When DeSimone heard about the threat, he went to Jerothe's apartment and knocked on the door. Jerothe opened the door, and punched DeSimone in the face. DeSimone then shot Jerothe between the eyes, killing him.He also garotted Burke's best friend, Dominick Cersani, on the former's orders in a Cadillac outside Robert's Lounge for being an informant for the police. Cersani was buried in the partially unfinished basement of the saloon.DeSimone was alleged to have taken part in the December 1978 Lufthansa heist from JFK International Airport, the largest robbery in U.S. history at the time. The loot is reputed to have been almost $6,000,000, only a fraction of which was recovered. He was picked out by having very well polished shoes, too well polished for an airport employee. He was the one who suggested recruiting his ex-cell mate Angelo Sepe for the heist.Hill claims that during the week after Christmas 1978, after murdering Lufthansa robber and mob lackey Parnell \"Stacks\" Edwards in his home in Ozone Park, Queens, DeSimone was going to become a \"made\" member of the Lucchese Family; due to a heavy snowfall, however, the murder was called off. A few weeks later, DeSimone disappeared.In Gangsters and GoodFellas, Hill mentioned that DeSimone had killed around four people in prison, bringing the total to around 10. Hill commented that DeSimone would murder someone just because he wanted to try out a new firearm and wouldn't hesitate to use someone as human \"target practice\".DeSimone then murdered Stacks Edwards. DeSimone was a good friend of Stacks' and was disappointed to hear that he had failed to get rid of the truck used in the Lufthansa Heist in New Jersey where the evidence would be destroyed. But when he was told by a ranking mafioso that he could become a made man off of this hit, he agreed. Once he found out where Stacks was hiding, he visited Stacks and shot him six times in the chest and head using a silenced pistol.On January 14, 1979, DeSimone's wife, Angela, reported him missing. Theresa Ferrara, Martin Krugman, Robert McMahon, Joe Manri, Parnell Edwards and Paolo LiCastri had all been murdered following the Lufthansa Heist, by Burke, who wanted to avoid paying them their share of the loot. For years, the New York Police Department and the FBI believed that DeSimone had either been murdered by Burke, or that he was in hiding to avoid being killed. His brother-in-law, Lucchese family member Joseph \"The Barber\" Spione, also disappeared shortly afterward.When Hill became an FBI informant in 1980, he told authorities that DeSimone had been murdered by the Gambino crime family. The full details were unknown until 1994, when Hill, in his book Gangsters and Goodfellas, gave the whole story of the events leading up to DeSimone's death. Hill's wife, Karen, had been having an affair with Hill's boss, Mafia Caporegime Paul Vario. When Hill was sentenced to prison, DeSimone approached Karen for sex. When she turned him down, DeSimone attempted to rape her. In retaliation for the attempted rape, Vario approached the Gambino crew and revealed that DeSimone had murdered Jerothe and William Devino without first seeking permission from the Gambino crime family, violating mafia protocol. On January 14, 1979, DeSimone was contacted and told that he was going to be \"made.\" Peter Vario and Bruno Facciolo took him to a house, where he was whacked by Thomas Agro.Agro confessed in 1985 that he was the driving force behind the ruse. Agro assassinated him on the orders of John Gotti, and also admitted to murdering DeSimone's brother Anthony after he turned informant. Agro admitted this to informant Joe \"Joe Dogs\" Ianuzzi. Agro also at times suggested murdering the eldest and last remaining brother, Robert. According to Ianuzzi, Agro would often laughingly refer to killing the third DeSimone brother, stating that \"Maybe it is time to go for the DeSimone trifecta!\" Another account, told by Hill in Gangsters and GoodFellas, states that Gotti himself was the assassin. On May 17, 2007 on the Howard Stern Show, Hill reaffirmed that Gotti had killed DeSimone.DeSimone was declared legally dead by the FBI in 1990.[edit] In popular culture\nDeSimone's infamy rests on the depiction of him given by actor Joe Pesci in the 1990 movie Goodfellas (renamed \"Tommy DeVito\" in the film), a role for which Pesci won the 1990 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The movie took some artistic liberties: Pesci's character, Tommy DeVito, is shown ramming an ice pick into Martin Krugman's head; Hill claimed that DeSimone was dead by the time Krugman was killed. At various points in the film, Tommy DeSimone is substituted for various individuals not portrayed in the film. For instance, in the double-date scene where Hill meets his future wife, Tommy DeVito is substituted for Paul Vario's son, Paul Jr, who actually went on the date.Hill, nevertheless, calls Pesci's portrayal \"between 90 and 95 percent accurate\", mentioning only that Pesci did not physically resemble the tall, muscular DeSimone, who was only in his teens and twenties during the events depicted in Goodfellas. Also, in real life, Vario allowed the Gambinos to kill DeSimone in retaliation for the murder of Batts and Foxy Gerothe, whereas in the film, elder members of the family solely execute Tommy DeVito for killing a \"made man\" without permission, although Henry's narration makes a reference to the true events, saying \"Tommy was murdered as revenge for Billy Batts and a lot of other things.\" In the film Pesci is killed by a character based on Thomas Agro, but unlike his real-life counterpart, his remains are found shortly afterwards and he is given a funeral.","Karen Friedman (born circa 1947) is one of three daughters of a strict Jewish family and grew up in Nassau County, New York. In 1965 she was working as a dental hygienist, and after work she and Dana Shapiro would go to the Villa Capra on Cedarhurst Avenue in Brooklyn for drinks. It was there that she first met Henry Hill, while on a double date with Shapiro and Paul Vario, Jr.After four months of dating they eloped to North Carolina, where they married on August 29, 1965. They had first tried to wed in Maryland, but could not get a blood test right away so they kept going.The newlyweds returned to Karen's mother's house, where they lived upstairs in a large remodeled bedroom suite. Henry decided to convert to Judaism, after growing up Catholic, because her parents wanted them to remarry in a Jewish ceremony.The marriage was tumultuous, and both Karen and Henry were involved in drugs and extramarital affairs. They officially separated in 1989, and Karen filed for divorce in 1990, but it was not finalized until 2002.Karen and Henry raised two children, Gregg and Gina, first in New York and later in various locations while they were in the Witness Protection Program, including Nebraska, Kentucky, and Washington.Today she lives under a new name and runs her own business. The events of her life were portrayed in the 1990 film GoodFellas by actress Lorraine Bracco.","Paul Vario (July 9, 1914 November 22, 1988) was a member of the U.S. Italian Mafia and a Caporegime in the Lucchese Family. Some reports say that he also was the Underboss of the Luccheses in the 1970s but was either demoted or resigned. Vario is a maternal cousin of Colombo crime family consigliere John Oddo and his brother, mobster Steven Oddo. He ran his own crew. Additionally Vario was thought to have held the position of acting underboss for Stefano LaSalle of the Lucchese crime family just prior to the conviction of then mob boss Carmine Tramunti and before Anthony Corallo became of the official leader. Under the rule of Corallo the Underboss rank went to Salvatore \"Tom Mix\" Santoro.Vario lived all his life in New York City and was believed to be involved in loansharking and union racketeering. The Vario crew stole from the neighboring JFK International Airport through hijacking. Prior to 1963 the airport was known as the Idlewild Airport and was also then used as fountain for stealing. Besides the Vario crew, the well-known Gambino family crew led by Carmine Fatico and later John Gotti also exploited the airport for their own criminal gain. According to former Vario associate Henry Hill, the airport was like the crew's 'personal Citibank'. Due to his influence over the cargo haulers' union, Vario could often threaten with a labor strike in order to turn an investigation away. During the 1980s the FBI would listen in with hidden microphones as fellow Lucchese family members and associates boasted 'we own JFK', an obvious testament to the power and influence Vario wielded.Illegal gambling and loansharking were also staples for Vario and his associates. It was believed that any form of gambling (most commonly numbers game, bookmaking or underground casinos) that operated in the Brownsville-East New York section of Brooklyn paid regular 'protection' (extortion) payments. It was common knowledge that any racketeer wishing to operate in this area had to pay Vario and his brothers a portion of their earnings.He and his brothers were involved in a number of legitimate businesses, including a flower shop, restaurant and cabstand, from which he would conduct business most of the time. Brother Tuddy ran the cabstand and Presto Pizzeria. The Vario family's earnings from various rackets and businesses were estimated to be $25,000 a week. Vario and his brothers, along with their criminal associates, operated in Brownsville. Both the cabstand and pizzeria were located in close proximity on Euclid Avenue and the cabstand was the Euclid Avenue Taxicab and Limousine Service.According to Hill, Vario never used a phone because he always believed it was too easy for someone else to overhear his conversations. Instead he would meet with his soldiers or other intermediaries who would talk to the people Vario needed to communicate with. Another show of his paranoia was when Lenny Vario met a girl, named Veralynn, it was at the same double date that Hill met his soon to be girlfriend, Linda. According to Hill, Paul insisted that the two women were FBI and was nervous and eager to leave when introduced to them. He was married with three sons, all of whom became involved in their father's dealings in one way or another.Nicknamed \"Paulie\", he stood six feet tall and weighed 250 pounds, but his narrow bone structure gave the appearance that he weighed even more than that. Former associates likened him to a sumo wrestler. A popular legend holds that Vario would often eat without a fork, instead holding the plate up to his face and shoving his mouth over the food.In the early 1970s Paul was a Membership Director for mob boss Joe Colombo's Italian-American Anti-Defamation League. However he rescinded his membership and withdrew all support when it became apparent that the relentless accusations Colombo was making against the FBI and U.S. government about racism and anti-Italian discrimination were attracting attention, which could easily divert from Colombo and his supporters' politics and into their criminal behaviour.It was also during the 1970s that Vario began to come under greater scrutiny from the FBI. Since the late 1960s the Vario brothers had ventured into the junkyard business, most likely a front for a chop shop operation and would use an on-site trailer as an office to discuss business-legal and illegal. As a result of the surveillance Vario was indicted but refused to cooperate. He was eventually found guilty of contempt and conspiracy to commit perjury and was sentenced to three years. Prior to his conviction it was thought that Vario was serving as the underboss to then boss Carmine Tramunti. Vario was shipped off to the federal prison located in Lewisburg, PA. While in prison Vario was part of the infamous 'mafia row'. This was a tier of fellow mobsters and according to Hill they lived like kings compared to other prisoners with wine and fine food. Hill was also serving a sentence at the Lewisburg facility. Additionally, infamous Lucchese soldier John Dioguardi (Johnny Dio) was serving time and according to Hill acted as a cook for Vario and others.Following Vario's release from prison in 1975, it was quite clear that he would not return to previous underboss slot for the Lucchese crime family, as it was apparent that Anthony Corallo had made his intentions of having Salvatore \"Tom Mix\" Santoro fill the role.According to Hill, Vario forbid those closest to him to engage in narcotics trafficking (although while in prison Hill openly dealt narcotics with Vario's blessings). During the first few years of his release, Vario maintained his strong ties to the notorious Lucchese family capo and well-known dope trafficker Joseph \"Joe Beck\" DiPalmero. Due to their surveillance, the FBI believed that Vario had financed at least one large scale cocaine shipment with the assistance of DiPalermo. The shipment involved 30 tons of the narcotic that was seized in the borough of Queens following a tipoff to the DEA. At the time the estimated value was $1.5 million USD. Vario's misfortune was soon forgotten when he approved of the Lufthansa Heist in 1978 and collected a handsome tribute payment.Vario was an extremely wealthy man. He once showed Henry Hill a vault claiming it held one million dollars in cash.Amongst Vario's associates were Jimmy Burke and Hill. Vario owned a cab stand across the street from the apartment where Hill grew up, and took Hill under his wing when the boy was twelve or thirteen, having him run errands and act as a valet. As the years went by, Vario initiated Hill into criminal life, telling all of his associates that Hill was his nephew. It was while on a double date with one of Vario's sons that Hill met his wife, Karen. Karen later became a courier for Hill, running messages to Vario, with whom she had an affair. When Burke's protege Tommy DeSimone attempted to rape Karen Hill, Vario held a sit-down with members of the Gambino family and revealed to them that DeSimone was responsible for the murders of two of their members, prompting them to murder DeSimone. Vario was imprisoned in 1984, largely because of the testimony of Hill.Vario was known to be brutal and ruthless, despite his portrayal as brooding and gentle in Goodfellas. Hill saw a show of this violence first hand. He watched, aged twelve or thirteen, as Vario drove up to a barmaid's apartment, took a baseball bat from the trunk of his car and severely assaulted her for telling his wife that the two were having an affair. The barmaid's collar bone was broken.He died while incarcerated at the Ft. Worth federal prison located in Tarrant County, Texas on November 22, 1988, aged seventy-four. His body is buried at St. John's Cemetery, Middle Village, Queens, New York.Paul had a wife, Phyliss and three sons, Peter, Paul, Jr., and Lenny Vario, all of whom became involved in crime. Paul Jr. was a good friend of mobster Hill and introduced him to his first wife Karen Hill. Lenny was allegedly Paul, Sr.'s favorite son, he burned to death whilst torching property in connection with a union. Little is known about his other son, Peter. Vario adored Phyliss and was once so enraged that a maitre 'd spilt wine over her that he sent his entire 'crew' to the restaurant, where they assaulted the staff.Paulie also had four brothers; Vito 'Tuddy' Vario (1928-1988), Salvatore Vario (1919-1976), Leonard Vario (1909-1981), and Thomas Vario (1917-1984). The Vario family originated from Sicily. The etymology of the Vario surname is that it was originally a nickname given to a person who lives in or comes from the property of Vannius.In the 1990 film Goodfellas, chronicling Henry Hill's life in the Mafia, Vario is featured as a major character. He is called \"Paul Cicero\" instead and portrayed by Paul Sorvino. In an ironic twist, Vario was convinced to go see director Martin Scorsese's 1973 film Mean Streets. Vario was so impressed by the film that he implored his associates to also see the movie.In the 2001 film for TV, The Big Heist, following the events of the 1978 Lufthansa Heist, Vario was played by actor Gino Marrocco.","null","null","Robert McMahon, also known as \"Frenchy\" and \"Bobby McMahon\" (Wantagh, New York July 24, 1936 May 16, 1979 Flatlands, Brooklyn, Mill Basin, Brooklyn), was the night-shift Air France cargo handling supervisor at John F. Kennedy International Airport from 1957 to his death in 1979. He helped orchestrate the 1967 Air France Robbery, and is a suspect in the 1978 Lufthansa heist.Robert McMahon was an Anglo Irish-American who had the stereotypical appearance of an accountant or a Wall Street banker. He stood at 5'7\" and had a thin physique with naturally curly black hair. He suffered from poor vision and wore prescription glasses. Robert had earned the comical nickname \"Frenchy\" from working at the Air France terminal at JFK airport. McMahon's alliance with the La Cosa Nostra was always tenuous. He had inherited the relationship from his former boss, Thomas Lucchese, who had himself inherited a tradition going all the way to Charles Luciano. When consorting with criminals Robert was always seen wearing expensive thousand-dollar business suits. He was a middle-aged bachelor with the remnants of a playboy image. Among members of the Vario Crew he was considered part of the upper-crust, known as the \"lace curtain\" Irish, and looked upon the \"shanty\" Irish like Burke and associates as a hopeless and disdainful breed, but never spoke publicly about his thoughts. He was born in Wantagh, New York to immigrants of Kildare, Ireland. He belonged to an old Irish family who had been land owners, physicians, lawyers, businessmen and local politicians for generations when settling in Bethayres, Pennsylvania, a small village in Lower Moreland Township, Pennsylvania. By the time Robert was born his family was financially secure and lived very prosperously, as McMahon's surviving relatives do to this very day off the family's mass fortune. Robert grew up under financially secure circumstances from this inherited wealth. One of Robert's ancestors, Thomas McMahon served as supervisor of Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania for thirteen consecutive years.Robert attended Hofstra University in Hempstead, Long Island, New York and earned a bachelor's degree and a keen business sense. While at Hofstra Robert also learned how to fluently speak the French language and read it, which he used when calling to the airline's head offices located at Charles de Gaulle International Airport situated in Paris, France. He first was a freight supervisor at Air France before he was promoted to cargo foreman. As a grown man and airport executive, he was a womanizer, having romantic trysts with Air France airplane stewardesses and prostitutes and was a recreational drug user. The McMahon family's inherited wealth cushioned McMahon from financial hardship and his life was far from a struggle. He was a large man with a love for fine cuisine, alcohol, boisterous in nature and very humorous. In 1979 Robert was involved in a relationship with his third wife and was raising several children that he had fathered from his two previous marriages. He lived in Hempstead, Long Island which members of the Vario Crew were envious of. Fellow hijacker friend Henry Hill admired and commended Robert for shielding his family from police scrutiny for his involvement in the major hijacking operations at the airport.Robert wasn't a gangster and he didn't understand being a gangster. Coming from a wealthy family he didn't understand what it was like to be broke, to have to go out and steal or hijack trucks for a living. He didn't understand gangsters like Paul Vario, Jimmy Burke, Henry Hill or Thomas DeSimone, anyone who dedicated his life to crime. Robert was the one responsible for obtaining the keys for the storage room that helped Henry Hill and Tommy DeSimone pull off the 1967 Air France Robbery. Jimmy Burke's Queens, New York bar Robert's Lounge was not named after McMahon nor was he a partner. Even with Robert's wealth he was neglectful of paying child support and alimony payments to his two ex-wives. He was able to form as a figure of Long Island society, enjoying trips overseas through Air France to Paris, France and generally made the most of his life. Robert was not a mobster, or a career criminal, but idolized the lifestyle and enjoyed associating with the likes of Jimmy Burke, Henry Hill and Tommy DeSimone. He was one of the many employees of the airport who needed little urging to toss an expensive looking suitcase or a crate of television sets onto a passing truck heading off the runway. Special Agent Arthur Stiffel, in charge of U.S. Customs at the airport later said, \"The people assisting in thefts around here are often just squaring a $2,000 or $3,000 debt to a loan shark.\"\nBecause of Robert's criminal association with the Lucchese crime family, Casey Rosado who was the President of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union at John F. Kennedy Airport with backing from the Lucchese crime family and Johnny Dio, protected McMahon from being terminated from his key position at Air France by threatening his employers with a union strike. McMahon was one of the Robert's Lounge crew who organized the Lufthansa Heist. Even after his murder, his friend Joe Manri was revealed to have been identified by police as an \"associate of Jimmy Burke\", but McMahon was not largely considered a suspect. Within hours following the Lufthansa heist his fellow employees had both named McMahon and his friend Manri as likely \"inside men\" that had motive and means to help pull of the Lufthansa heist.\nThrough his work at the airport Robert and Joe Manri became close and inseparable friends. They had many things in common, both used their positions at the airport to commit crimes, and both were constant womanizers. Around May 1979, having successfully pulled off the Lufthansa heist, Robert fell into marital problems with his third wife, ultimately facing an impending divorce, and became estranged from her and his children.\nHis friend Joe dutifully allowed him to sublet an apartment in South Ozone Park, Queens with him.McMahon was killed along with twelve others allegedly on the orders of Jimmy Burke, who either didn't wish to give McMahon a fair share of the estimated $68 million loot or was afraid that he would become an FBI informant. It is also in the book Wiseguy by Henry Hill that McMahon was very talkative and had a boisterous nature about him. His close friendship with co-worker Joe Manri also caused a worry with both Henry Hill and Jimmy Burke from the very beginning of the robbery, while still in planning, that McMahon might unintentionally tell or brag about his involvement in such a large robbery as the Lufthansa heist. He also could implicate Burke in the 1967 Air France Robbery, which at that time was still unsolved.\nOn May 16, 1979, a school boy walking to school passed a brown four-door 1975 Buick LeSabre parked along Schenectady Street in the Flatlands section of Brooklyn, New York; inside were two men who looked to be sleeping. When he peered closer he saw the blood and realized that the two had both been shot through the back of the head - one was McMahon and the other was his best friend Joe Manri. Henry Hill suspected that Jimmy Burke paid fellow Lufthansa heist suspect Paolo LiCastri $50,000 to murder the two airport employees. Paolo LiCastri would later be found murdered, most likely at the hands of his benefactor Jimmy Burke. The two Lufthansa employees were not shot and dumped in a dumpster to be discovered by sanitation workers, as portrayed in the movie Goodfellas. During the initial investigation conducted by police upon discovery of the bodies, one of the onlookers in the crowd was rising mobster Sammy Gravano who would briefly mention seeing the slain corpses of McMahon and Manri in their Buick Riviera in his biography.","William 'Billy Batts' Devino (January 19, 1921 June 11, 1970) William Paul DeVino was a made member of the Gambino Family and a longtime friend of boss John Gotti in the 1960s. After spending six years in prison, Devino was murdered by Tommy DeSimone, with the help of Jimmy Burke and Henry Hill after the fact.Born in Brooklyn, little is known about Devino's early life. In 1959, he became an associate of the Gambino crime family and was made in 1961. Devino met Jimmy Burke in 1962 and was on friendly terms with him. He also knew Tommy DeSimone and Henry Hill from when they were children. Devino was a protegee street soldier for Carmine Fatico and later Gotti, during the early days when Gotti was a habitu\u00e9 of the Bergin Hunt and Fish Club in Ozone Park, Queens. In 1964, Devino went to Bridgeport, Connecticut to complete a drug deal for Joseph \"Joe The Crow\" DelVecchio and Oreste \"Ernie Boy\" Abbamonte. Upon his arrival, Devino was arrested by undercover police for possession and exchange of narcotics. He was later convicted and sentenced to 6 years in the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut.On June 9, 1970, Devino was released from prison. Two days later, while celebrating his release at a bar called The Suite in Jamaica, Queens, Devino ran into Tommy DeSimone. Devino had not seen DeSimone since he was in his early teens. Devino remarked that DeSimone used to shine shoes. DeSimone took this remark as an insult, but held his anger in check.The common belief, perpetuated by the movie Goodfellas, is that Devino was murdered for insulting DeSimone at the Suite. However, the real reason for the Devino murder was that Burke had taken over Devino's loanshark business while Devino was in prison. According to Hill, Devino had been 'squawking' to Joe Gallo, about getting his enterprises back from Burke. Not wanting to give the business back to Devino, Burke decided to kill him instead. Hill also said that Devino was insulting DeSimone because he wanted to impress some mob associates from another crime family who were in the bar. Devino was too drunk to be able to fend off anybody on the night he was killed.After setting off to dispose of Devino, the trio had a minor collision with a van on the Van Wyck Expressway in Queens. Soon after, the sound of thudding in the trunk made them realize that Devino was still alive. They then stopped at DeSimone's mother's house to collect a knife, some lime, and a shovel. She made them drink coffee, chat and have some breakfast while the critically wounded Devino was still in the trunk. Upon arriving at an isolated piece of land in Connecticut owned by Ralph Atlas, a friend of Burke's, the trio opened the trunk of the car, killed Devino, and buried him under a dog kennel. In The Real GoodFella, Hill said that they \"didn't actually shoot him, they just stabbed him, thirty or forty fucking times, fucking horrible.\" However, in Wiseguy, Hill does not mention a knife. In the movie Goodfellas, Devino is shot and stabbed.Six months after Devino's burial, Atlas mentioned to Burke that he was going to develop the property where Devino was buried. Burke ordered Hill and Tommy to dig up Devino's half-decomposed corpse and dispose of it. Hill has told various versions of the night Devino was killed, including burials in Pennsylvania, Upstate New York, and Connecticut. In Wiseguy, Hill said the body was crushed in a mechanical compactor at a New Jersey junkyard.It is believed that Tommy DeSimone was murdered on January 14, 1979, partly as revenge for his part in the Devino murder - Devino was a made man, and therefore \"untouchable.\" without family permission. It is unknown if this was the sole reason. John Gotti may have wanted revenge for the killing of Ronald Jerothe, because had the Gambinos known the full story of Devino killing with Burke and Hill as participants, the two would surely have been killed as well.In the book Gangsters and GoodFellas, written by Hill, it states that Devino's birth name was William Paul DeVino. However, FBI Agent Edward McDonald informed an aide to Hill that Devino's name was really Billy Batts and nothing else.Devino is portrayed by Frank Vincent in the film Goodfellas.","null","null","null","null"],"ImageURL":["http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNzM4MzcxMDg4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDEyNDY3Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY425_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjA1MDMxMTgxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMwMjMwNA@@._V1._SX640_SY429_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTY1NTUxMDMxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTAyNDY3Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY629_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMzk5NTkwMjQ4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTEyNDY3Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY425_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTI5NzcyOTE1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDEyNDY3Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY450_.jpg","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"],"Name":["James Conway","Henry Hill","Tommy DeVito","Karen Hill","Paul Cicero","Frankie Carbone","Sonny Bunz","Frenchy","Billy Batts","Morris Kessler","Tuddy Cicero","Janice Rossi","Tommy's Mother"]},"14":{"Actor":[],"Bio":[],"ImageURL":[],"Name":[]}},"Link":"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0099685\/","Title":"Goodfellas"},{"Characters":{"0":{"Actor":["Mark Hamill","Harrison Ford","Carrie Fisher","Peter Cushing","Alec Guinness","Anthony Daniels","Kenny Baker","Peter Mayhew","David Prowse","Phil Brown","Shelagh Fraser","Jack Purvis","Alex McCrindle","Eddie Byrne","Drewe Henley"],"Bio":["He is born to Padm\u00e9 Amidala, moments before his twin sister, Leia. His mother dies in childbirth. Jedi Masters Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi hide the children to prevent the newly declared Galactic Empire and its ruler, Palpatine, using them to gain greater control over the galaxy. Leia would go to Alderaan and grow up a princess, the adopted daughter of Senator Bail Organa, and Luke would be taken to the desert planet of Tatooine to be raised as a moisture farmer by his Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru. Obi-Wan would then go into exile on Tatooine to keep an eye on Luke during his formative years.19 years later, Luke lives a humdrum existence on Tatooine with his aunt and uncle, who have kept his father's true history a secret from him. He makes his first steps toward his destiny when he finds two droids, C-3PO and R2-D2; he meets Obi-Wan, whom he knows as the eccentric hermit \"Ben Kenobi\", for whom a message in R2-D2's memory system is intended. Obi-Wan tells him that his father was a Jedi, killed by Darth Vader. He then presents Luke with his father's lightsaber. Obi-Wan offers to take Luke to Alderaan, but Luke rejects his offer.Luke changes his mind when he discovers his aunt and uncle have been killed by Imperial stormtroopers. They catch a ride with the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca on their ship, the Millennium Falcon, only to find that Alderaan has been destroyed by the Empire's new superweapon, the Death Star.The group sneaks onto the Death Star and rescues a captive Princess Leia; in the process, Obi-Wan sacrifices himself in a duel with Vader. Luke is heartbroken, but finds the strength (with help from Obi-Wan's spirit) to join the Rebel Alliance and destroy the Death Star.Three years later, Luke is a commander in the Rebel Alliance. While on a mission on the ice planet Hoth, he is nearly killed by a Wampa; he escapes with the help of the Force and his lightsaber. In the frozen wasteland, he sees the spirit of Obi-Wan, who tells him to travel to the planet Dagobah and complete his training under Jedi Master Yoda. Han Solo then saves Luke from freezing to death, having rode out into the night to do so.When the Empire discovers the Rebel base on Hoth, Luke leads a snowspeeder squadron to cover the evacuation. Escaping Hoth in his X-wing, he travels to Dagobah, rather than regrouping with the Alliance. There, he meets Yoda and undergoes rigorous Jedi training, increasing his power in the Force.His training is interrupted by a vision of his friends in pain. Against Obi-Wan and Yoda's advice, he travels to Cloud City to save them, only to be lured into a lightsaber duel with Darth Vader. As his mentors warned, Luke proves to be no match for the powerful and experienced Vader. After losing his right hand, he learns the truth: Darth Vader is his father. Vader offers him the chance to turn to the dark side of the Force and rule the galaxy at his father's side. Horrified, Luke chooses to die rather than be corrupted and throws himself into a deep reactor chasm. However, he is sucked into a garbage chute to the underside of Cloud City and left hanging onto a weather vane. Leia, flying away from Cloud City in the Millennium Falcon, senses Luke's peril and turns the ship around to save him. Aboard the medical ship after rejoining the rebel fleet, Luke's missing hand is replaced with a robotic one.Luke, along with Leia, the droids, and Lando Calrissian, save Han Solo from the gangster Jabba the Hutt, who had acquired the carbonite-encased Solo after the events in the Cloud City. Luke offers to negotiate with Jabba, but instead is forced to fight a fearsome monster, the Rancor. When Luke kills it, Jabba sentences him to be thrown into a The Pit of Karcoon, to be eaten by the Sarlacc. Luke escapes with R2's help, saving his friends and destroying Jabba's barge. We also learn Luke has constructed a new green lightsaber.\nDuring the Battle of Endor, Vader confronts Luke in an attempt to turn him to the dark side.During his return trip to Dagobah, Luke learns from the dying Yoda that Vader is indeed his father, and from Obi-Wan's spirit that Leia is his twin sister. Yoda tells Luke that he will not truly be a Jedi until he confronts his father. Luke insists that there is still good left in Vader, and pledges to bring him back from the dark side.Arriving on Endor as part of a Rebel commando squad, Luke surrenders to Vader in an attempt to bring the Dark Lord back to the light side of the Force. He ultimately becomes a prisoner of the Emperor on the second Death Star, in orbit around Endor.The Emperor and Vader attempt to turn Luke to the dark side with promises to save his friends from certain death. When that fails, the Emperor goads Luke to strike him down to save the Rebels, who are losing the Battle of Endor. Luke momentarily lashes out, but Vader blocks his strike, and father and son face each other in a final duel. Luke tries to keep his emotions under control until Vader senses the existence of Luke's sister and threatens to turn her instead. Enraged, Luke attacks with full fury. Vader loses ground as Luke lands blow after blow; Luke eventually forces Vader on his back and severs his father's mechanical right arm. With The Emperor ordering Luke to strike Vader down to take his place, Luke glances at his own bionic hand and realizes with a visceral horror that he's on the verge of suffering his father's fate. Luke regains control, deactivates his lightsaber and emphatically throws it away, passing Yoda's final test and proudly declaring his allegiance to the Jedi.The Emperor uses Force lightning against Luke in retaliation, nearly killing him. In horrible pain, Luke calls out to his father for help. In an act of self-sacrifice, Vader seizes the Emperor and throws him to his death down a reactor shaft. In the process, Vader is mortally wounded. On the deteriorating Death Star, Luke (at his father's request) removes the mask that had encased Anakin Skywalker's face, and looks upon his father's eyes for the first and only time. Anakin dies moments later, assuring his son that there is still good in him after all. Luke escapes with his father's remains. On Endor, in the manner of a Jedi's funeral, Luke burns the last vestiges of his father that had been Darth Vader. During the Rebel Alliance's victory celebrations on Endor, Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan, Yoda, and his father.","Contents [hideshow]\n\n1. A New Hope\n2.  The Empire Strikes Back\n3.  Return of the Jedi\n\nA New Hope\nAt the beginning of A New Hope, Solo and Chewbacca are notorious smugglers. However, during one Kessel Run, the Imperial Navy intercepts and boards their ship, forcing Solo to jettison his cargo to avoid arrest. This results in a large and mounting debt to his former employer, Jabba the Hutt, who places a bounty on Solo's capture. Desperate to pay off his debt to Jabba, Solo accepts a charter to transport Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker, and their two droids to the planet Alderaan. As a result, Solo reluctantly becomes involved in the Rebel Alliance and helps them rescue Princess Leia from Imperial custody, though he claims he is \"only in it for the money,\" and parts ways with the rebels after delivering them to safety and receiving his payment. However, near the end, he has a change of heart, and helps Luke Skywalker destroy the Death Star at the Battle of Yavin. As a result, Solo is handsomely rewarded and given, along with Luke Skywalker, the Alderaanian Medal of Freedom. The Empire Strikes Back\nIn The Empire Strikes Back, set three years later, Solo again attempts to leave the Rebel Alliance as he is still being relentlessly pursued by Jabba's minions. However, he is once again dragged back into action when he saves Skywalker from freezing to death and Princess Leia from an Imperial invasion of the rebel base on Hoth. It is likely that Solo's personal feelings toward the princess played a major role in his decision. He takes her to hide on the planet Bespin, but his old friend Lando Calrissian betrays him and turns them over to Darth Vader, who was informed of their location by Solo's nemesis, bounty hunter Boba Fett. After being tortured by Vader, Solo's body is frozen in carbonite and given to Fett as a reward, who then delivers the incapacitated Solo to Jabba. Return of the Jedi\nSix months later, during the events of Return of the Jedi, Skywalker, now a nearly full-fledged Jedi, rescues Solo from Jabba (with help from Leia, Chewbacca, and a penitent Calrissian). Upon rejoining the rebels, Solo, now promoted to general, accepts their offer to lead the commando raid on an Imperial shield generator facility on the forest moon of Endor. By destroying the shield generator, they allow rebel fighters to enter the Death Star's superstructure and destroy it in the ensuing Battle of Endor, permanently crippling the Empire.","Contents [hideshow]\n\n1. Main Biography\n2. Expanded Biography\n\nMain Biography\nLeia Organa had accomplished much at a young age: a leader in the Alliance to Restore the Republic, a former member of the Imperial Senate, and a member of the Royal Family of Alderaan. Yet despite her stature, for many years, Leia herself was not privy to much of her true heritage.\nIt was common knowledge throughout the court that Leia was adopted into the Royal Family. What wasn't common knowledge was that Leia was born to Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi pupil who succumbed to the dark side and became Darth Vader. She was one of a set of twins, born in secrecy and protected from Vader and the Emperor. The Jedi hero and general, Obi-Wan Kenobi, saw to it that Leia was secretly transported to the planet Alderaan, where she was to be raised by Kenobi's friend Bail Organa. The boy, Luke, was taken to the distant world of Tatooine. Leia has few memories of her true mother, Padm\u00e9 Amidala. All that Leia can recall is that she was beautiful, but sad.Leia followed in her adoptive father's footsteps, and entered politics. She became the youngest senator ever in the Imperial Senate, representing Alderaan. As a senator, Princess Leia ran a number of \"diplomatic aid missions\" that were fronts for Rebel resupply missions. She used her diplomatic immunity and her consular ship to gain access to restricted areas.One such mission saw Leia's ship intercepting vital Imperial plans stolen by Rebel spies. These plans, the complete technical readouts of the Death Star battle station, could be exploited by the Alliance to secure a sizable victory over the Empire. Armed with the Death Star plans, Leia was given a mission by her father to find one of the Republic's greatest heroes and recruit him into the Alliance. En route to the planet Tatooine to find General Obi-Wan Kenobi, Leia's ship was attacked by Imperial forces, and she was taken prisoner by Lord Darth Vader. She barely had time to hide the stolen plans into the memory systems of an R2 unit, and ordered it to find Obi-Wan on Tatooine.As a prisoner of Vader, Leia underwent terrible torture aboard the Death Star. In addition to the mind probes, the Imperials forced her to witness the destruction of her home planet of Alderaan. Despite this, she refused to reveal the location of the hidden Rebel base, or the whereabouts of the stolen plans. Shortly thereafter, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo rescued her from the battle station and carried her and the stolen plans to the Rebel base on Yavin's fourth moon. Due to Leia's efforts, and the help of her companions, the Death Star was eventually destroyed.Three years later, the Alliance had set up a new base on the frozen world of Hoth. Princess Leia was one of the commanding members of Echo Base. When the Imperials attacked Hoth, Leia took the initiative, and acted in a number of command roles, ordering the evacuation of the base. Leia's access to her own escape transport was cut off, but she managed to escape in Han Solo's Millennium Falcon.Evading Imperial pursuit, the Falcon landed in an asteroid field so that its crew could repair the vessel. It was during these quiet moments that Princess Leia Organa fell in love with Han Solo. The two voiced their love on Cloud City of Bespin, where the Imperial forces tracked them. Darth Vader captured Han Solo, and Leia was forced to watch as the Dark Lord froze him in carbonite, and then handed him over to the bounty hunter, Boba Fett. Leia escaped Cloud City with the aid of its administrator, Lando Calrissian.The Rebels eventually tracked down Boba Fett as the bounty hunter delivered Han's carbon-frozen form to Jabba the Hutt. Leia participated in Luke's plan to free the captured Solo from the clutches of the vile gangster. She posed as Boushh, an Ubese bounty hunter and infiltrated the palace, freeing Solo from his carbonite imprisonment. Her identity was revealed, and for a time, she had to endure the humiliation of being made one of Jabba's slaves. She repaid the gangster, however, by strangling the Hutt with the very chain that bound her.Leia rejoined Alliance High Command in time to accompany General Han Solo's strike team on the moon of Endor. Their mission was to destroy the shield generator protecting the second Death Star. While on Endor, Leia became separated from the strike team, and befriended an Ewok tribe. Her diplomatic skills aided in convincing the Ewoks to help the Rebel force. It was shortly thereafter that Luke revealed their true lineage to her. For a time, Luke and Leia kept their true relation and their parentage a secret from all but their most trusted friends.During the ground battle at the Imperial complex, Leia sustained a slight blaster wound. After the victory at Endor, Leia continued to demonstrate some ability in the Force, being able to sense her brother's presence.Leia is a driven, dedicated individual. She has a forceful, some would say abrasive, personality. She is professional in all respects, but occasionally relaxes her guard to let her strong compassion and quirky sense of humor show. Leia is a petite, fair-skinned human female with brown eyes, and long brown hair that she often wears in an elaborate fashion.Expanded Biography\nLeia was raised in a life of privilege, a stark contrast to her twin brother who grew up on the harsh desert world of Tatooine. Despite this, Leia never grew soft or decadent. Her strong personality and bright intellect molded her into an exceptional person, one that Bail Organa loved and was very proud of. She avoided the vagaries of court politics and intrigue, and instead concentrated on bettering herself and helping others.\nLeia had a happy childhood, learning in the best institutes on Alderaan, and studying politics, history and art. Leia's interest in art was one of her main reasons for joining the Rebellion. Learning how the Empire controlled expression really cemented her devotion to the Alliance's cause. Leia learned history from one of the greatest professors in the galaxy, Arn Horada. She was taught self-defense and combat skills from Giles Durane, the Weapons Master.When the galaxy plunged into civil war, Leia's diplomacy and martial skills served the Rebel Alliance. On a diplomatic mission to Ralltiir, a world subjugated by the Empire, she discovered a wounded Rebel with information stored in his brain through hypnotic imprint. This Rebel had the news of the Death Star operation. Learning of the abominable weapon, Leia discovered that there was no redeeming the Empire. What was to some an ordered, structured government built on the ashes of a corrupt and ineffective Republic was to Leia a vile villain to be destroyed. One of her first open acts of Rebellion was simply self-defense -- Leia was attacked by Imperial Lord Tion for her Rebel affiliations, and she was forced to take his life.Fully committed to the Alliance cause, Leia's convictions were by no means swayed by the Alderaan tragedy. She continued to serve the Alliance in diplomatic capacities. En route to a conference on Circarpous IV, Luke and Leia crash-landed on the jungle planet Mimban. There, Leia was forced to face Darth Vader during a quest for the legendary Kaiburr Crystal. Leia held off the Dark Lord single-handedly with Luke's lightsaber before Skywalker was able to defeat him. Vader was merely toying with her, scarring her continuously with his deadly blade. Luke used the Kaiburr's healing power to mend Leia's grievous wounds.Leia attended an important Conference of Uncommitted Worlds on the planet Kabal after the Battle of Yavin. There, she recruited the Aquaris Freeholders to the Alliance. The Freeholders proved very resourceful and valuable when the Alliance abandoned Yavin as their base. During the Alliance relocation, Leia was able to access lost Organa resources of money and capital on Ord Mantell greatly needed for the Rebel war effort. Leia's efforts were also felt in the distant Minos Cluster, where she helped unify Rebellion against the Empire.In the months that followed the Battle of Hoth, Leia felt torn between her duties to the Rebellion and her devotion to Han. Although she and her friends continued their search for Boba Fett, she still had Alliance missions to undertake. In her devoted search for Solo, Leia found herself drawn into the underworld of Black Sun, a vast criminal syndicate that permeated the entire galaxy. There, she was almost seduced by Prince Xizor, the ruler of the organization. His handsome features and irresistible pheromones nearly wooed Leia to his side, but she overcame his temptation.After the Battle of Endor, Leia went on a number of diplomatic missions on behalf of the newly founded Alliance of Free Planets. When the New Republic replaced the interim government, Leia was one of the inner council members that helped shape its growth.Four years into the New Republic's rule, the normally isolationist government of the Hapes Consortium began making entreaties. The Hapan Prince Isolder proposed marriage to Leia, offering the vast wealth of the Hapes Cluster to the Republic in exchange for her hand. Han Solo would have none of it. In a characteristically brash and reckless move, Han kidnapped Leia and stole away to Dathomir, a world he won in an incredible game of sabacc. Though Solo was an expert at marksmanship, piloting and smuggling, his idea of the \"romantic\" could have definitely used some work. Despite eloping to a world full of evil Force-weilding witches and an Imperial garrison, Leia's heart still chose the scruffy-looking scoundrel over the dashing prince, and Han and Leia were married shortly thereafter.Now known as Leia Organa Solo and the New Republic Minister of State, she set out on her most challenging role: that of mother. Leia gave birth to twins, Jacen and Jaina, during one of the New Republic's most trying times. Against a backdrop of war unleashed by Imperial warlord Grand Admiral Thrawn, Leia delivered two healthy and very Force-sensitive babies. A year-and-a-half later, she had a third child, Anakin.When Mon Mothma stepped down from her position of Chief of State of the New Republic due to health issues, she passed on the mantle of leadership to Leia. Organa Solo ruled for several years, guiding the Republic through numerous crises as the government experienced growing pains.Though Leia stepped away from public office, she still remained a valuable member of the New Republic hierarchy. Her relief efforts during theYuuzhan Vong crisis are well known. The mother of full-grown Jedi Knights, Leia still brandishes her lightsaber and Jedi heritage, though she readily admits regret that her political career had interfered with her early Jedi training.Her connection to the Force helped her weather the trying times of the Yuuzhan Vong crisis. Leia struggled to keep her family together during the invasion, becoming the emotional anchor when the tragic death of Chewbacca deeply affected Han. Grief-stricken, Solo withdrew from his commitments as father and husband.Following a near-death experience on Duro, Leia and Han were reunited, and bolstered each other's strength, renewing their commitment and faith in their love. Such strength was vital, for more bloodshed was to scatter the Solo family. Leia's headstrong son, Anakin, died in a heroic mission into Yuuzhan Vong territory. The pain and anguish of that loss echoed through the Force, crippling Leia with despair.Yet she did not lose all hope. Her remaining two children also felt the loss of Anakin. Jacen was held captive by the Yuuzhan Vong, and most in the New Republic believed him dead. But Leia held onto her adamant belief that Jacen was still alive, even though he seemed undetectable through the Force. Jaina plunged herself into her dangerous career as a starfighter pilot, leading foolhardy sorties against the Yuuzhan Vong. The young pilot worked hard to build walls around her emotions, and even excluded her mother from her war-weary heart for a time. The two were eventually able to settle their differences.After months of uncertainty, the remnants of the Solo family were finally reunited as the fragments of the New Republic consolidated its push against the Yuuzhan Vong. While Leia stayed clear of any official involvement in the newly formed Galactic Alliance government, she continued her service as a skilled diplomat, flying missions into territories that had lost contact with the rest of the galaxy during the invasion, and attempting to weave together the fragments torn apart by the Yuuzhan Vong.","Grand Moff Tarkin was the Governor of the Imperial Outland Regions. He was appointed Grand Moff - the only Imperial officer to hold such a title - by Emperor Palpatine. He was so close to the Emperor that he was given some authority over even Darth Vader (as evidenced in a meeting of Imperial General Staff when he orders Vader to stop 'the grip' on General Motti). Tarkin's ambition to succeed Palpatine as emperor had led him to use extreme methods to quell the rapidly growing Rebel Alliance. His major project was to undertake the construction of the Death Star battle station (he is seen briefly in 'Revenge of the Sith' next to the Emperor & Vader, watching the construction of the big, steely orb that will become the Death Star). When the Death Star was completed, it was to be used as a base to rule the entire galaxy. With a superlaser capable of destroying an entire planet, it was considered by Tarkin & other Imperial General Staff to be invincible. When the Death Star's plans are stolen, the Emperor assigns Darth Vader to recover them - and the recovery attempt results in the capture of Princess Leia but fails to recover the plans. Tarkin is obsessed with finding the Rebels' main base, and he has Vader resort to extreme measures - such as torture - to find out that location. Even though Vader has her tortured, she tells him nothing, and Tarkin suggests that threatening the Princess' home world - Alderaan - with the Death Star's destructive power. Tarkin's bluff works - to a point, as Princess Leia gives him the name of Dantooine. But the fiendish Tarkin orders Alderaan's destruction all the same, and then finds out that Dantooine was NOT the Rebels' main base. Tarkin gives the order to terminate her, but she is rescued by Luke Skywalker, Han Solo & Chewbacca before it can be carried out. When he finds out the Princess has escaped, Tarkin comes up with a plan; he will have a homing beacon placed on Han Solo's 'Millenium Falcon' in the hope that if the ship escapes, it will lead them to the secret Rebel base. With the tractor beam put out of action by Ben Kenobi, Tarkin's plan works, and the Death Star is led to the fourth moon of Yavin. However, the Rebels launch an offensive attack against the Death Star, consisting of dozens of X- and Y-Wing fighters. They are too fast for the Death Star's slow-moving turbolasers, designed for use against capital ships. Tarkin, however, believes his battle station is invincible, even when told by one of his officers that the attacking Rebels do present a danger. The Grand Moff stubbornly refuses to leave his post in the Death Star's main command center, and watches as the fourth moon comes up on the Death Star's targeting screen. Seconds after giving the order, 'You may fire when ready', Tarkin is dead - the Death Star is blown apart when Luke Skywalker's torpedoes find their mark and strike the reactor.","Obi-Wan Kenobi is a Jedi Knight, and a major character in the Star Wars saga. He is one of only four characters; the others being Anakin Skywaker, C-3PO and R2-D2; who appears in all six films. Obi-Wan acts as a mentor to Anakin Skywalker and his son Luke Skywalker.\n\n\nContents [hideshow]\n\n1.  Prequel trilogy\n1.1.  The Phantom Menace\n1.2.  Attack of the Clones\n1.3.

Return of the Jedi\n\n Prequel trilogy\n The Phantom Menace\nIn The Phantom Menace, 25-year-old Obi-Wan accompanies Qui-Gon on a mission to Naboo, a planet ruled by Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala. After making an unscheduled landing on Tatooine, his master stumbles upon Anakin Skywalker, a young slave who shows tremendous potential with the Force. Believing the boy to be the prophesied \"Chosen One\" who would bring balance to the Force by destroying the Sith, Qui-Gon asks the Jedi Council that the boy to be trained as a Jedi. Obi-Wan is also amazed by Anakin's unprecedented midi-chlorian count and strong Force potential, but initially thinks he should not be trained, believing the boy is already too old and has too many emotional attachments to become a Jedi. The Jedi Council agrees, and forbids training for Anakin, in whom they see a great deal of fear and anger.During the film's climactic battle scene, Queen Amidala and her entourage of guards split up from her Jedi bodyguards when the Sith Lord Darth Maul arrives to eliminate the Queen. Wielding a double-bladed lightsaber, Maul simultaneously battles both Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. After being separated from the duel via laser walls, Obi-Wan watches in horror as Maul impales his master. Obi-Wan engages Maul in a fierce duel, cutting Maul's lightsaber in half, but the Sith Lord knocks Obi-Wan into a reactor chasm and kicks his lightsaber into the depths below. Obi-Wan grabs onto an extending pole, breaking his fall. He then calms himself and reconnects with the Force, utilizing it to hurl himself into the air and simultaneously bring his master's lightsaber into his hand, startling Maul and giving him just enough time to slash the Sith Lord in half. The dying Qui-Gon tells Obi-Wan to train Anakin to be a Jedi, and Obi-Wan promises that he will.For his heroics in defeating a Sith (making him the first Jedi in 1,000 years to do so), Yoda personally bestows the rank of Jedi Knight upon Obi-Wan, who then says that he would take it upon himself to train Anakin whether the Council allowed him to or not. Yoda reluctantly agrees, but warns Obi-Wan to be careful with the troubled boy. Attack of the Clones\nIn Attack of the Clones, set 10 years later, Obi-Wan has become an experienced Jedi Knight. By this time, his relationship with his padawan is strained; Anakin has grown powerful but arrogant, and believes that his Master is trying to hold him back.He and Anakin are tasked with protecting Padm\u00e9, now a Senator, after an attempt is made on her life. Obi-Wan tracks the mysterious assassin to the planet Kamino, and learns about a massive clone army that the planet's inhabitants are building for the Galactic Republic. He then meets with the bounty hunter Jango Fett, the template for the clones, and figures out that he is the one responsible for the assassination attempts on Padm\u00e9. Obi-Wan attempts to apprehend Fett, who escapes to Geonosis with his unaltered clone Boba. Obi-Wan follows them by placing a homing beacon on Fett's ship, Slave I.On Geonosis, Obi-Wan learns of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, also known as the Separatists, a conspiracy of star systems that wants to secede from the Republic. The renegades are led by rogue Jedi Count Dooku, who was once Qui-Gon's master. Obi-Wan is captured shortly after sending a message to Anakin. While in captivity, Dooku reveals that the Galactic Senate is under the control of a Sith Lord called Darth Sidious.Later, Anakin and Padm\u00e9 arrive on Geonosis to rescue Obi-Wan. They are themselves captured, however, and all three are sentenced to death by the Geonosians. The executions are prevented by the timely arrival of Jedi and clone reinforcements, led by Jedi Masters Mace Windu and Yoda. Obi-Wan and Anakin confront Dooku and engage him in a lightsaber duel. Dooku strikes Anakin with Force lightning, then turns the deadly barrage onto Obi-Wan, who easily blocks the attack with his lightsaber. The two duel and Dooku outmaneuvers Obi-Wan, striking him on both his left arm and leg. Dooku is about to deliver a killing blow when Anakin recovers from the lightning and blocks Dooku's attack. Dooku and Anakin fight a short duel, and Dooku cuts off Anakin's right arm (which is later replaced by a robotic prosthetic). Yoda arrives and fights Dooku as well, but the Sith escapes; he creates a distraction by nearly killing Obi-Wan and Anakin. Revenge of the Sith\nIn Revenge of the Sith, set three years later, Obi-Wan and Anakin board the Separatist leader General Grievous' flagship, the Invisible Hand, and fight their way to the captive Chancellor Palpatine. There, they find Dooku, who engages them both in a duel. During the duel, Obi-Wan is rendered unconscious, leaving Anakin to face Dooku alone. Anakin defeats Dooku and, at Palpatine's urging, executes the defenseless Count, in violation of the Jedi Code.When Palpatine appoints Anakin to the Jedi Council as his representative, the Council disapproves, considering Anakin too young and headstrong, and reasons that his membership gives the Chancellor a vote in Jedi affairs. Anakin protests when the Jedi Council denies him the rank of Master and orders him to spy on Palpatine, but Obi-Wan talks him into accepting it, warning Anakin of his \"dangerous\" friendship with the Chancellor.Obi-Wan is called away to Utapau to confront General Grievous. This leaves Palpatine, who is secretly Darth Sidious, free to continue corrupting Anakin. The Sith Lord eventually manipulates the young Jedi into embracing the dark side as the Sith Lord Darth Vader.Obi-Wan engages Grievous in combat and shoots and kills him with a blaster. Moments later, however, Obi-Wan's own clone forces turn on him; Unbeknown to Obi-Wan, Palpatine had issued Order 66, directing clone troopers to turn on their Jedi generals. Obi-Wan survives the attempt on his life and escapes by stealing Grievous' star fighter and rendezvousing with Senator Bail Organa and Yoda aboard Bail's ship, the Tantive IV.Along with Yoda and Bail, Obi-Wan returns to Coruscant, where he and Yoda discover that every Jedi in the Jedi Temple has been murdered, even the younglings. They kill the clones remaining at the Temple, and discover that the clones were led there by Anakin. Obi-Wan reprogrammes a beacon, which had been instructing all remaining Jedi to return to the Jedi Temple (where they surely would be killed), by instructing them to scatter across the galaxy and remain in hiding. Subsequently, Obi-Wan and Yoda split up to confront the two Sith Lords, Darth Vader and Darth Sidious. Obi-Wan wishes to fight Sidious, hating the thought of having to kill his friend and pupil. Yoda, however, insists that Obi-Wan telling him \"to fight this Lord Sidious strong enough you are not\", and that he will have to accept that Anakin had been \"consumed by Darth Vader.\"Unaware of his former Padawan's location, Obi-Wan goes to visit Padm\u00e9, who secretly married Anakin and is now pregnant with his child. He tells her what Anakin has done, and reveals that he knows about their marriage. A horrified Padm\u00e9 refuses to accept what Obi-Wan tells her, but is brave enough to go out and confront Anakin herself. Obi-Wan stows away in her ship.Obi-Wan finds Vader at the volcanic planet Mustafar, and attempts to reason with his former student to pull him away from the dark side. When he emerges from Padm\u00e9's ship, however, Vader immediately suspects that Padm\u00e9 has betrayed him, and uses the dark side to force choke her into unconsciousness. Obi-Wan has no choice but to engage him in a long and epic duel, which ranges through the Mustafar mining complex, the lava rivers, and finally the black sand. Obi-Wan tries to persuade Vader to relent, but Vader ignores his warnings and leaps forward to deliver the killing blow. Obi-Wan sees an opening and severs Vader's legs and remaining arm with one stroke. Obi-Wan refuses to finish him off however, and leaves him burning on the volcanic slopes, taking Anakin's lightsaber with him. Vader then slides too close to the lava and nearly burns to death. He survives long enough to be rescued by Palpatine, and is later placed in the iconic black body armor first seen in \"Revenge of the Sith\" and the rest of the original triology.Obi-Wan assists in hiding Anakin's children after Padm\u00e9 dies in childbirth. Luke is put on Tatooine with Owen Lars, so that Obi-Wan can look after him in secret, while his twin sister Leia is put on Alderaan in Bail's care. Yoda then tells Obi-Wan that he has more training for him: the spirit of Qui-Gon would teach him how to retain his identity through the Force and commune with the living after death. Original trilogy A New Hope\nIn A New Hope, Obi-Wan is known to the inhabitants of Tatooine as Ben Kenobi, an eccentric hermit who lives in the Jundland Wastes (he had assumed this identity to hide from the Empire). He's first seen rescuing Luke Skywalker from Tusken Raiders while the boy looks for R2-D2. Obi-Wan presents Luke with Anakin's lightsaber, but when Luke asks Obi-Wan about his father, Obi-Wan disguises the truth from him, saying, \"a young Jedi named Darth Vader... betrayed and murdered your father.\" (Obi-Wan reasoned in Return of the Jedi that Anakin Skywalker died the moment he betrayed the Jedi, completely becoming Darth Vader). R2-D2 then plays the message from Princess Leia Organa asking for Obi-Wan's help in delivering the schematics of the Death Star to her foster father on Alderaan. Obi-Wan invites Luke accompany him to Alderaan and aid the Rebellion against the Empire, but Luke initially refuses. However, when Luke discovers that Imperial troopers hunting down the stolen Death Star plans have killed his uncle and aunt and destroyed their home, he changes his mind. Obi-Wan takes young Luke under his wing in order to teach him the ways of the Force with the intention of fully training the boy later on Alderaan.Obi-Wan and Luke buy passage to Alderaan on the Millennium Falcon, a freight ship owned by smuggler Han Solo and co-piloted by Chewbacca, a Wookiee. Before they can reach their destination, however, Alderaan is destroyed by the Death Star on the orders of Grand Moff Tarkin. The Millennium Falcon is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam. By a quirk of fate, Princess Leia is on board, and her rescue is gallantly executed by Han and Luke. Obi-Wan, meanwhile, sets off to disable the tractor beam so that the Falcon can escape. Obi-Wan is aware of Vader's presence, and knows he isn't coming back. He deactivates the tractor beam and confronts Vader in a lightsaber duel. At the climactic moment in the duel, after telling Vader \"if you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine,\" and just as Luke and the others are making a run for the Falcon, Obi-Wan allows Vader to strike him down, and his body vanishes as becomes one with the Force. In the ensuing confusion, Luke hears Obi-Wan's voice instructing him to \"run, Luke, run!\" and the group makes their escape aboard the Falcon.During the film's climactic battle, Obi-Wan continues to communicate with Luke through the Force, giving him guidance and counsel as Luke destroys the Death Star. The Empire Strikes Back\nIn The Empire Strikes Back, set three years later, Luke is knocked out on the plains of Hoth, and Obi-Wan's force ghost appears telling Luke to go to the Dagobah system for further training with Yoda. After Luke has been trained as a Jedi, Obi-Wan appears in Dagobah to try and dissuade him from going to Cloud City, where Vader holds Han and Leia hostage, as he feels his young apprentice is not yet ready to face Vader one-on-one. After Luke insists on facing Vader, Obi-Wan says sadly that he couldn't help him.Luke is nearly killed in a lightsaber duel with Vader, who reveals to him that he is his father and tries to enlist him into the dark side of the Force. Luke escapes, but is haunted by the truth Obi-Wan withheld from him. Return of the Jedi\nIn Return of the Jedi, set one year later, a dying Yoda confirms to Luke that Vader is indeed his father. After Yoda's death, Obi-Wan appears on Dagobah as a Force Ghost to explain to a heartbroken Luke why he did not tell him the truth about his father, and to confess that Leia was his sister. Obi-Wan admits that his own pride had been partly to blame for Anakin Skywalker's fall from grace: \"I thought I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong.\" He then tries to explain to Luke that killing Vader is the only way to destroy the Empire and save the galaxy, even if it means committing patricide.At the end of the film, Obi-Wan's ghost appears alongside the ghosts of fellow Jedi Yoda and a redeemed Anakin on the forest moon of Endor, watching over Luke and his comrades as they celebrate the destruction of the second Death Star and, with it, the Empire.","C-3PO, also spelled See-Threepio, also called Threepio for short, was a protocol droida droid specifically designed to interact with organics. C-3PO's TranLang III Communicator module combined with his AA-1 VerboBrain allowed him to be fluent in over six million forms of communication. He was also equipped with over thirty secondary functions. C-3PO was generally seen with his counterpart, R2-D2, a small, wheeled R2-series astromech droid. C-3PO's main function as a protocol droid was to assist with etiquette, customs, and translation so that meetings of different cultures ran smoothly. In his time, C-3PO loyally served over forty masters. He hated adventure and space travel, as they often resulted in him coming out on the wrong end of a fight, losing parts, and having them reattached, sometimes incorrectly. Together with R2-D2, C-3PO played a pivotal role in galactic history, however lowly he may have thought of himself.","R2-D2, phonetically spelled Artoo-Detoo or Artoo, was an astromech droid and undoubtedly the most famous unit of the R2 series. A longtime friend and counterpart of the protocol droid C-3PO, he served the Skywalker family faithfully for many years. Along with his resourcefulness, R2-D2 was equipped by his original owners, the Royal House of Naboo and the Royal Naboo Starfighter Corps, with many tool-tipped appendages that allowed him to serve as a superior starship mechanic and computer interface specialist. A bold droid in personality and temperament, R2-D2 would often enter dangerous situations without second thought in order to give aid to his masters. This adventurous streak served his companions well on numerous occasions, often turning the tide of galactic history.R2-D2 was a diminutive droid, standing 0.96 meters tall. He rolled on three legs, one could retract into his body, and had a silver and blue domed head. His white, blue, and silver body housed many arms, sensors, and other apparatuses, many of which were not readily seen by the typical humanoid eye. This often made the droid seem like a box of tricks, unexpectedly pulling out some previously unseen but much needed device at a critical moment.While R2-D2 contained many specialized gadgets, he was also quite good at taking the initiative and often employed unorthodox means to help his friends.","Contents [hideshow]\n\n1. Main Biography\n2. Additional History\n\nMain Biography\nAn immense, fur covered warrior of great strength and loyalty, Chewbacca the Wookiee was a well-known figure in both the underworld and in the Rebel Alliance. Born on Kashyyyk over two centuries before the Battle of Yavin, Chewbacca was a wise, sophisticated being with exceptional skills in starship piloting and repair.\nChewbacca is a veteran of the Clone Wars, the galaxy-wide conflict that pitted the clone armies of the Republic against the droid forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Wookiee was part of the high command tasked with protecting Kashyyyk from droid invasion. There, he served with fellow Wookiee Tarfful and the Jedi Master Yoda.The wise Yoda had maintained a good relationship with the denizens of Kashyyyk, earning the respect of the mighty Wookiees. When events surrounding the rise of the Empire resulted in the clone forces betraying their Jedi generals, Chewbacca and Tarfful remained loyal to Yoda, helping the Jedi Master escape the clone trap.For their brutish strength and technological savvy, Wookiees were enslaved by the Empire for use as labor. For a time, Chewbacca was a slave, toiling away for the betterment of the Empire until an impudent Imperial cadet named Han Solo freed him.Drummed out of the military, Solo had few options but to return to the fringe lifestyle he knew so well. Chewbacca swore loyalty to Han, and became his partner in crime. The two of them became a well-known smuggling duo. When they came into ownership of the freighter Millennium Falcon, their exploits became legendary.Chewbacca and Solo spent hours modifying and tinkering on their beloved Falcon, souping it up far beyond its original performance specs. Although the Falcon's upkeep was a labor of love, many a time Chewie unleashed his legendary temper on the recalcitrant freighter, banging his massive furry hands against delicate components that refused to behave.Chewbacca became Solo's conscience of sorts. Though the smuggler maintained a mercenary air of bravado that refused to adhere to any ideals other than self-preservation, Chewie was openly the more compassionate of the two. Perhaps it was the ordeal suffered by his people at the hands of the Empire that caused Chewie to feel this way. Although Solo steered clear of any allegiance during the Galactic Civil War, Chewbacca definitely supported the Rebel cause, though the two of them tried to avoid the struggle altogether.Ironically, a simple steerage assignment landed them in the heart of the Rebel Alliance. Desperate for cash, Chewie and Han took on a charter of two passengers and their droids from Tatooine to Alderaan. Little did the two smugglers realize that their cargo consisted of a legendary Jedi Knight, the son of the prophesied Chosen One in Jedi mythology, and a pair of droids containing information vital to both the Empire and the Alliance. This trip inextricably drew Chewbacca and Solo into the Rebel fold, and they continued flying missions for the Rebellion for years after that.Chewbacca stood over two meters tall and had a coat of ginger-brown fur. He wore nothing, save for a bandoleer that held specialized ammunition for the bowcaster that he carried, and a simple tool pouch so that he could enact the many repairs the chronically malfunctioning Falcon required.Additional History\nUnlike most Wookiees who rarely stray from the lush forests of Kashyyyk, Chewbacca's youthful wanderlust took him far from the confines of his green homeworld. His travels first included many remote and dangerous locales on Kashyyyk before taking him to the stars. Chewbacca's heart, however, was firmly rooted on Kashyyyk, and he would always try to make it home for important Wookiee holidays to share with his family.\nFollowing the Clone Wars, the Empire subjugated the planet -- ostensibly to punish the world for harboring Jedi fugitives, but mostly to exploit the Wookiees as slave labor. Chewbacca escaped capture for a time, helping his people as best as he could while living the life of a fugitive.Early on in their smuggling career, Chewbacca stunned Han Solo by returning to Kashyyyk to marry a female Wookiee named Mallatobuck. Solo never pegged Chewie as a family man, but Wookiee customs allowed Chewbacca to continue his flying with Han -- protecting him as the Wookiee life debt demanded -- while still being a husband and, eventually, father. Chewbacca's son, Lumpawarrump, was raised mainly by Malla and Chewie's father, Attichitcuk. Chewie continued to fly the spacelanes, avoiding Imperial patrols and smuggling contraband for various clients, but he returned often to Kashyyyk, to celebrate the Wookiee holiday of Life Day.Wookiees define family differently than most species. To a Wookiee, an \"honor family\" contains the closest of friends, and Chewbacca swore loyalty to all of them, offering protection even at great personal risk. When Han Solo and Leia Organa married and began to raise their own family, Chewbacca took their children into his honor family, and helped guard and raise the three young Solos -- Jacen, Jaina and Anakin.When Chewbacca learned that Solo had been captured by the bloodthirsty Yevetha during the Black Fleet Crisis, he disobeyed Leia's orders and flew straight into the heart of enemy territory: the Koornacht cluster. With the help of his cousins Jowdrrl, Dryanta, and Shoran, and his son, Lumpawarrump, he rescued Han from Yevethan clutches.At the start of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, Han Solo and Chewbacca were on the planet of Sernpidal when it became a target of the alien menace. Using massive gravity-altering creatures called dovin basals, the Yuuzhan Vong began to drag Sernpidal's moon of Dobido from its orbit to the planet's surface. Han Solo, his teenaged son Anakin, and Chewbacca began organizing a desperate evacuation, cramming as many escapees aboard the Falcon as they could.Solo and Chewbacca have had many close calls in the past, and have executed countless last-second escapes; Sernpidal was not to be one of them. As the moon rushed closer to the surface, Chewbacca was cut off from the Falcon. Anakin was faced with a terrible decision. The Falcon could not wait any longer. Rather than endanger everyone aboard, Anakin piloted the ship away, leaving Chewbacca behind. Chewbacca stood his ground, howling defiantly at the immense moon as it crashed into Sernpidal's surface, killing the mighty Wookiee.","Contents [hideshow]\n\n1. As Anakin Skywalker\n2. As Darth Vader\n\nAs Anakin SkywalkerAnakin Skywalker is the central character in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. The original and prequel trilogies follow Anakin's rise as a vessel of The Force, his fall to the dark side, and his ultimate redemption. In the begining Anakin is a Jedi Padawan, and later a Jedi Knight of legend.Anakin first appears as a selfless nine-year-old boy. Anakin and his mother, Shmi, are slaves in the service of Watto, a junk dealer. Anakin can build or repair nearly anything, evidenced by the creation of his own protocol droid, C-3PO, and podracer, each from salvaged parts. He is also a remarkable pilot with quick reflexes.Anakin is found on the planet Tatooine by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, who is convinced that he is the \"Chosen One\" foretold by the Jedi prophecy to bring balance to the Force. Shmi says that he has no father, and that she simply became pregnant with him. Over the course of the narrative, Qui-Gon Jinn goes on to discover that Anakin has the highest known number of midi-chlorians, a measure of Force-aptitude. Anakin forms a strong bond with Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, whom Qui-Gon and his padawan apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, are guarding.After winning Anakin's freedom in a podrace, Qui-Gon brings the boy to Coruscant and requests that the Jedi Council allow him to train Anakin. This request is denied, as the Council thinks that Anakin's future is clouded by the fear he exhibits. Ultimately, Anakin helps win the final battle against the villainous Trade Federation. A dying Qui-Gon, slain by Darth Maul, urges Obi-Wan to train Anakin, and Council leader Yoda reluctantly approves. The Republic's newly-elected Supreme Chancellor, Palpatine, befriends the boy, promising to \"watch his career with great interest.\"10 years later, Anakin, now twenty, is Obi-Wan's padawan. Because his natural abilities place him far above his peers, he has developed into an arrogant loner during his years of Jedi training, and has begun to chafe against Obi-Wan's authority.He is assigned to guard Padm\u00e9, and eventually falls in love with her, even though such emotional attachments are forbidden to Jedi. In conversation with Padm\u00e9, he reveals his affection for her, as well as his distrust of the political process and the need he perceives for there to be one strong leader.While guarding Padm\u00e9, Anakin senses that his mother is in danger. Upon returning to Tatooine, he finds his mother in a village of Tusken Raiders, but arrives too late; she has been tortured and beaten beyond help, and she dies in his arms. Seized by a blind rage, he slaughters the entire village, even the women and children. He returns with his mother's body, and tearfully confesses to Padm\u00e9, who forgives him.Anakin and Padm\u00e9 learn that Obi-Wan has been taken hostage by the droid forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a faction of star systems that want to secede from the Republic. They rush to to the planet Geonosis to rescue him where they are also captured. Faced with their impending demise in a gladiatorial arena, they profess their love to one another. Escaping the fray with the help of a cadre of Jedi and the clone army, Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Yoda engage Separatist leader and fallen Jedi Count Dooku in a lightsaber battle. Obi-Wan is injured in the battle and Anakin is forced to fight him alone. He is easily defeated by the older, more experienced warrior, who severs his lower right arm. Back on Naboo, Anakin's arm is replaced with a mechanical prosthetic, and he marries Padm\u00e9 in a secret ceremony with only C-3PO and his counterpart, R2-D2, to witness.Some years later, Anakin and Obi-Wan return from the Outer Rim to rescue a kidnapped Palpatine. They board the Invisible Hand, flagship of the Separatist fleet and its cyborg leader, General Grievous. Tracking the captive Chancellor to the observation deck, they encounter Count Dooku. A brief battle ensues, in which Dooku renders Obi-Wan unconscious. Once again, Anakin is set to duel with the Count alone. Wanting revenge for his earlier defeat on Geonosis, Anakin overpowers Dooku and neatly sears off both of his hands. Palpatine then commands Anakin to behead the shocked Count. Anakin gives in to his anger and complies, but instantly regrets it, as killing a defenseless prisoner is not the Jedi way.After rescuing the Chancellor, Anakin finds that the flagship is in critical condition, and, with some help from Obi-Wan, barely lands its front half safely on an airstrip.Anakin returns to Coruscant, where Padm\u00e9 tells him she is pregnant. He is initially overjoyed, but that night has a horrible nightmare of Padm\u00e9 dying in childbirth. He is extremely afraid this vision will come true, as it is similar to the one he had of his mother just before she died.Palpatine, who by now has amassed near-dictatorial power in the Senate, makes Anakin his representative on the Jedi Council. The suspicious Council accepts Anakin, but denies him the rank of Jedi Master, and tell him to spy on Palpatine. His pride wounded, Anakin loses all faith in the Council. Ultimately, the Chancellor offers him the chance to learn the dark side, which he claims holds the power to prevent death. Anakin realizes that Palpatine is the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, and reports Palpatine's secret to Jedi Master Mace Windu. He soon follows Windu to the Chancellor's office to make sure Palpatine is taken alive.Anakin arrives to find Windu holding his lightsaber on a disarmed Palpatine. Windu declares the Dark Lord of the Sith under arrest, but Palpatine defiantly unleashes a torrent of Force lightning at Windu. The Jedi Master deflects the lightning with his lightsaber back at Palpatine, hideously scarring his face. The attack continues unabated until Palpatine seemingly tires, giving Windu a chance to strike a deathblow. Anakin pleads with Windu to spare Palpatine's life, but Windu refuses, insisting that Palpatine is too dangerous to be kept alive. As Windu raises his lightsaber to deliver the final blow, Anakin intervenes, severing Windu's right hand. Palpatine then springs to life, bombarding him with Force lightning and hurling him out the window to his death. Anakin then submits to the dark side, and is dubbed Darth Vader. Vader's first task as a Sith Lord is to assault the Jedi Temple and to kill everyone inside, including the children. Vader is then sent to Mustafar to assassinate the Separatist leaders. After completing this task, he is met by Padm\u00e9, who pleads with him to flee Palpatine's grasp with her. He refuses, saying that the two of them can overthrow Palpatine and rule the galaxy together. Obi-Wan, who had hidden himself on Padm\u00e9's ship, suddenly emerges. Vader accuses Padm\u00e9 of conspiring against him, and uses the dark side to choke her into unconsciousness. Kenobi and Vader then engage in an intense lightsaber duel throughout the mining complex. At the end of the duel, Kenobi severs Vader's left arm and both of his legs. As Vader comes into contact with the molten metal, he catches fire and is nearly immolated. Obi-Wan leaves him to die, but Palpatine comes to Vader's rescue.Palpatine reconstructs his apprentice's ruined body with the iconic suit of black armor. Once Vader regains consciousness, Palpatine tells him that Padm\u00e9 had died as a result of Vader's anger. (She had in fact died in childbirth after delivering Luke and Leia.) This half-truth breaks what remains of Anakin's spirit, and he screams in torment. He is last seen overseeing the construction of the first Death Star at Palpatine's sideAs Darth VaderIn Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope and Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, Vader is depicted as the cunning, brutal enforcer of the Galactic Empire's rule across the galaxy. Vader serves as the apprentice of Emperor Palpatine, using the dark side of the Force to mercilessly pursue the Jedi and the Rebel Alliance to the ends of the galaxy. The prequel trilogy recounts the heroic rise and tragic fall of Vader's former self, Anakin Skywalker.Darth Vader is the primary antagonist: a dark, ruthless figure, out to capture, torture, or kill the films' heroes to prevent them from thwarting the Empire.In A New Hope, Vader is charged with recovering the stolen plans of the Death Star and finding the Rebel Alliance's secret base. He captures and tortures Princess Leia and, along with Death Star commander Grand Moff Tarkin, destroys her home world of Alderaan. Shortly afterward, he duels his former master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, who has arrived at the Death Star to rescue Leia, and cuts him down, turning him into a spirit in the Force. He then encounters Luke Skywalker during a battle over the Death Star, and senses in him a great strength in the Force; this is confirmed moments later when the boy destroys the battle station. He was about to shoot Luke down using his TIE fighter, but Han Solo disables his ship using the guns on the Millennium Falcon, and sends Vader spinning into space.In The Empire Strikes Back, Vader captures Leia, Han, Chewbacca, and C-3PO on the planet Bespin to lure Luke into a confrontation. He strikes a deal with the administrator of Cloud City, Lando Calrissian to give Han over to the bounty hunter Boba Fett, and has Solo frozen in carbonite. Luke, who has been partially trained by Yoda, duels Vader, but is eventually defeated, losing his right hand to Vader's lightsaber. Vader then reveals his true identity as Luke's father and offers Luke the chance to overthrow Palpatine and rule the galaxy as father and son. Luke refuses, throwing himself down a mine shaft. He is sucked into a garbage chute and rescued by Leia, Chewbacca, Lando and C-3PO. He is fitted with a robotic hand to replace the one Vader had cut off.In Return of the Jedi, Vader is charged with overseeing the completion of the second Death Star. He meets with Palpatine on board the half-constructed station to plan Luke's turn to the dark side.\nDarth Vader escorting Luke Skywalker to Palpatine in an attempt to turn him to the dark sideBy this time, Luke has nearly completed his Jedi training, and has learned from a dying Yoda that Vader is indeed his father. He learns about his father's past from Obi-Wan's spirit, and also learns that Leia is his sister. On a mission to the forest moon of Endor, he surrenders to Imperial troops and is brought to Vader. Aboard the Death Star, Luke resists the Emperor's appeals to his anger and fear for his friends, but snaps when Vader telepathically probes his mind, learns of Leia's existence, and threatens to turn her instead. Enraged, Luke nearly kills Vader, severing his father's right hand. He controls his anger at the last minute, however, as he looks at Vader's cybernetic hand and then at his own; he realizes that he is perilously close to suffering his father's fate.As the Emperor approaches, encouraging Luke to kill Vader and take his place, Luke throws down his lightsaber, refusing to perform the killing blow. Angered, the Emperor attacks Luke with Force lightning. Luke writhes in agony under the Emperor's torture, begging his father for help. Unable to bear the sight of his son in pain, Vader turns on his master and throws him into the very core of the Death Star, where the evil emperor explodes in a fury of dark energies. However, Vader is mortally wounded by the Force lightning.Anakin Skywalker in his last few moments of lifeMoments from death, he begs his son to take off his breath-mask so he can look at Luke \"with his own eyes\". Luke complies and for the first (and as it turns out, the only) time, father and son truly see each other. In his dying breaths, Anakin Skywalker is redeemed, finally admitting to Luke that the good within him was not destroyed after all. Luke escapes with his father's body as the Death Star explodes, destroyed by the Rebel Alliance.That night, Luke cremates his father in his armor in the manner of a Jedi's funeral. During the victory celebration on the forest moon of Endor, Luke sees the redeemed spirit of Anakin Skywalker, standing once again with Obi-Wan and Yoda.","Owen Lars was the son of moisture farmer Cliegg Lars and the stepbrother of Anakin Skywalker. He married Beru Whitesun, and after his father's death, he inherited his job as a moisture farmer. In 19 BBY, Beru convinced Owen to adopt Anakin's son, Luke Skywalker, as Anakin had turned to the dark side and became the infamous Darth Vader.Owen and Beru raised their nephew as well as they could, and Owen instilled into Luke the values of his own childhood. Fearful of Luke's potential, and distrustful of the outside galaxy, Owen attempted to keep Luke isolated and ignorant of his true parentage.\"Owen Lars is the son of Cliegg Lars, husband to Shmi Skywalker-Lars, who is mother to Anakin Skywalker, aka Darth Vader.Anakin has twins with Queen Padme Amidala, who dies in childbirth. After Padme's death, Obi-wan Kanobi brings Shmi's grandson, Luke, to Owen and his wife Bertu to raise.In the original film, \"A New Hope\" Luke Skywalker refers to the character as \"Uncle Owen.\"null","Beru Whitesun Lars, the wife of Owen Lars, was a Tatooinian woman who raised Luke Skywalker after the fall of the Galactic Republic. Coming from a long line of moisture farmers, Beru Whitesun grew up near Mos Eisley on Tatooine. On a trip to Anchorhead, she met Owen Lars, the son of another moisture farmer, Cliegg Lars. Beru and Owen fell in love, and Beru later became part of the Lars family.Shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Owen's stepmother, Shmi Skywalker Lars, was kidnapped by Tusken Raiders, an event that brought Shmi's son, Anakin Skywalker, and his soon-to-be-wife, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, to the Lars homestead. Three years later, when the galactic conflict came to a close, Beru and Owen became the guardians of their new baby nephew, Luke Skywalker, after his father turned to the dark side of the Force and became Darth Vader.The Larses raised Luke like a son. Beru would often defend Luke's interests against Owen, who was overprotective of him out of fear that he would follow in Anakin's footsteps. When Luke wished to leave home to attend the Imperial Academy with his friend Biggs Darklighter and Owen would not allow it because he needed help on the farm, Beru convinced her husband to let Luke go after staying on for one more season. After a year had passed, Beru tried to convince Owen that it was time to let Luke move on, but they never had time to reach an agreement. The two were killed by Imperial stormtroopers, by order of Darth Vader, who were searching for a droid carrying the stolen Death Star plans.","Jawas are a nomadic trading race native to the planet Tatooine. They are passionate scavengers, seeking out technology for sale or trade in the deep deserts in their huge sandcrawler transports. A band of Jawas was responsible for locating C-3PO and R2-D2 and selling them to Luke Skywalker's uncle Owen Lars. This band was led by the \"Chief\" Jawa, whose authority was based primarily on his superior haggling and scavenging abilities. This Jawa tried to pass a defective R2 unit off on Lars, but it's bad motivator showed itself in time, and Lars chose the superior unit, allowing the Force to work its will through Luke Skywalker.","Jan Dodonna was one of the first generals in the Rebellion's military.He was one of the first captains of a Star Destroyer in the days of the Galactic Republic, having served in both the Stark Hyperspace War and the Clone Wars. Throughout his long period of service, Dodonna showed a strong grasp of tactics and strategy, and along with Adar Tallon, Dodonna wrote the book on modern space combat.","General Vanden Willard was a tactical advisor and military officer in the Alliance to Restore the Republic and New Republic.","Garven \"Dave\" Dreis was the commander of Red Squadron, and a T-65 X-wing starfighter pilot for the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Originally serving with the Rarefied Air Cavalry, Dreis fought in the Clone Wars that took place from 22 BBY to 19 BBY. During the Battle of Virujansi, Dreis had the opportunity to fly alongside the \"Hero With No Fear,\" Anakin Skywalker. In the wake of the Clone Wars and the subsequent Declaration of a New Order, Dreis joined the Rebel Alliancean organization dedicated to shaking the Galactic Empire's hold on the galaxy.In command of Red Squadron, Dreis took the call sign \"Red Leader,\" and the nickname \"Boss.\" He adopted a fatherly approach to commanding his men, and supervised the instruction of new recruits personally. In 0 BBY, he was posted at the Alliance's base on Dantooine, and was transferred to Yavin 4's Great Temple shortly afterward. From there, he led Red Squadron in an attack on the Empire's Death Star superweapon, which was moving to destroy the Alliance base. When an attack run on the battlestation's vulnerable thermal exhaust port from pilot Jon Vander's Gold Squadron failed, Dreis was forced to make his own attempt. He almost succeeded, but his proton torpedoes failed to enter the Death Star's exhaust port. Dreis was subsequently shot down by the Sith Lord Darth Vader."],"ImageURL":["http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTMxNTgwMTYxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjczMTY2Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY425_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNDMxMzIwMDk4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTczMTY2Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY428_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTI4NzI0MzIyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTgzMTY2Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY952_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjE0MDk1ODUxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTY4OTE2._V1._SX420_SY259_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjE4OTg0ODAxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjkxMTIyMw@@._V1._SX640_SY432_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjIyOTMyNTg2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTg1NjI4NA@@._V1._SX640_SY862_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTI5MTc3MTAzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzIyMTIyMw@@._V1._SX640_SY646_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTM2OTkwOTAyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEyMTIyMw@@._V1._SX640_SY962_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjE2MjY3MjQzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzAyMzA4NA@@._V1._SX640_SY958_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTgwMDI3MDc5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjIxMzA4NA@@._V1._SX640_SY423_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BOTE0NjEyMTcyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjUwNTI4NA@@._V1._SX640_SY417_.jpg","null","null","null","null"],"Name":["Luke Skywalker","Han Solo","Princess Leia Organa","Grand Moff Tarkin","Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi","C-3PO","R2-D2","Chewbacca","Darth Vader","Uncle Owen","Aunt Beru","Chief Jawa","General Dodonna","General Willard","Red Leader\n\n                \n                (as Drewe Hemley)"]},"15":{"Actor":[],"Bio":[],"ImageURL":[],"Name":[]}},"Link":"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0076759\/","Title":"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"},{"Characters":{"0":{"Actor":["Keanu Reeves","Laurence Fishburne","Carrie-Anne Moss","Hugo Weaving","Gloria Foster","Joe Pantoliano","Marcus Chong","Julian Arahanga","Matt Doran","Belinda McClory","Anthony Ray Parker","Paul Goddard","Robert Taylor","David Aston","Marc Aden Gray"],"Bio":["Thomas A. \"Tom\" Anderson (alias Neo):The word 'Neo' is an anagram not only of the word 'one,' but also for 'eon'. Neo is also Greek for 'new,' suggesting messianic overtones for his mission in the Matrix. In Gnosticism eon's, or aeon's, is a kind of superhuman being with supernatural powers.Neo has carried since his inception the Matrix's source code, known as the Prime Program. This gives him the ability to freely manipulate the simulated reality of the Matrix, similar to the authority a system administrator has over a given system. However, he mainly manifests these abilities as various superhuman powers.The power Neo exhibits most often is telekinesis - he seems capable of manipulating any object in the Matrix through will alone. By focusing this ability upon himself he can fly at amazing speeds and jump great distances. Whilst his speed is never specified, he flies from The Merovingian's mountain manor to the highway \"500 miles due south\" in fewer than 15 minutes (2,000 miles per hour), implying that his \"cruising speed\" is in excess of three times the speed of sound. His speed of flight is further exemplified by his ability to \"outfly\" explosions and the fact that as he flies, objects around him tend to twist, catch fire, or smash; the sonic boom left in his wake has the power to overturn rows of heavy vehicles.Further, Neo possesses superhuman strength and agility, and is able to brush off attacks that would kill or disable a normal human being with relative ease. His reflexes are great enough to dodge bullets in a manner similar to the Agents (though he usually stops them outright with his telekinesis). However, his strength and endurance have limits. Even though he could block a sword with the edge of his hand, he received a small cut, indicating (as the Merovingian pointed out) that he was still human despite his powers. His endurance is also finite: when confronted by masses of Smith clones in the second film, Neo was forced to escape rather than continue fighting, and upon exiting the Matrix, he appeared visibly tired and out of breath.Neo has displayed the ability to heal people within the Matrix, even to the point of resurrecting the recently deceased (though the extent and limits of this ability are not known).A more subtle application of Neo's ability is a heightened awareness of the simulated nature of the Matrix, enabling him to easily detect Agents, Exiles, and other anomalous phenomena (such as the presence of explosives). He is even capable of a limited form of precognition. The ability to see the Matrix's inner workings has been referred to as \"Code Vision.\" This has been described as \"seeing the world without time\", or visualizing possible futures like a chess player looking several moves ahead.In addition, Neo (like most Red Pills) utilizes the Resistance's combat programs, which grant combat abilities equivalent to a martial artist with decades of experience. However, Neo is able to run an unprecedented number of these programs simultaneously; he is therefore a master of every known martial art and fighting style, including Kung Fu, Jujitsu, Karate, Eskrima, Drunken Boxing, and Taekwondo (the Nebuchadnezzar ship operator Tank uploads each of these martial arts programs (and more) to Neo's brain during his training in the first movie) (However, in training for the series, Keanu Reeve's fighting arsenal, as well as the entire cast's, emphasizes Wushu.)In the real world, Neo has some degree of wireless connectivity with the Matrix system: he eventually learns to sense the presence of the Machines, and even interfere with their function. This capability actually overwhelms him at first, causing him to involuntarily jack into Mobil Avenue Station without the equipment normally used by the Resistance. According to the Oracle, \"The power of the One extends beyond this world [the Matrix]. It reaches from here all the way back to where it came from.\" Apparently because of his status as The One; he has a direct connection to the Source, and can therefore affect everything connected to it. Additionally, after he is blinded in the fight against Smith\/Bane, Neo begins to perceive everything connected to the Source, including the Machine City itself, as silhouettes of golden light.","Morpheus is the captain of the Nebuchadnezzar, which is a hovercraft of the human forces of the last human city, Zion, in a devastated world where most humans are grown by sentient Machines and kept imprisoned in the Matrix, a virtual computer-generated world. Morpheus was once a human living inside the Matrix until he was freed earlier in life.Morpheus is apparently a very popular public figure in the city of Zion. He is also known in the Matrix, but as a dangerous terrorist wanted by Agents (who are actually sentient programs that patrol the Matrix, eliminating any human that is a threat to the secret of the Matrix or dispatching programs that exile themselves in the Matrix to avoid their deletion).Like other hovercraft crews, Morpheus and his crew are dedicated to the protection of Zion and the freeing of humans from the Matrix.In fact, Morpheus is the Greek god of dreams in Greek mythology, which is consistent with the character involvement with the \"dreaming\" of the Matrix.Earlier in his life, Morpheus gained the romantic attention of Niobe, another hovercraft captain. Their relationship became estranged shortly after Morpheus visited The Oracle, an ally living in the Matrix. The Oracle could foretell the future, and she told Morpheus that he would be the person who would find The One, a human with superhuman abilities within the Matrix and who could end the Human\/Machine war. Since that visit, Morpheus spent much of his life searching the Matrix for The One.In the first feature film, The Matrix, Morpheus successfully finds and monitors a pod-human named Thomas A. Anderson, a hacker who calls himself Neo. Despite a close call with Agents that capture, interrogate, and place a surveillance device on Neo, Morpheus and his crew locate Neo. Morpheus offers Neo a choice of ingesting a red pill, which will activate a trace program to locate Neo's body in the real world and allow the Nebuchadnezzar crew to extract him, or a blue pill, which will leave Neo in the Matrix to live and believe what he wants to believe. Neo takes the red pill. The Nebuchadnezzar crew is then able to eject Neo's body from the Matrix powerplant and retrieve him from the cold sewers where the machines patrol. Morpheus takes a risk in helping Neo escape the Matrix, as human minds that live too long in the Matrix may have trouble in comprehending the real world and the truth of the Matrix. Initially, Neo does experience serious denial when Morpheus explains the truth, a point for which Morpheus apologizes.Shortly after Neo first visits the Oracle, Morpheus is captured and interrogated by Agents after a crew member, Cypher, betrays the crew, killing several members before being stopped. Since Morpheus, as a hovercraft captain, possesses access codes to the Zion mainframe computer, the surviving members of the ship's crew are about to unplug Morpheus from the Matrix without the ability to retrieve his mind or his body, a process that will kill him. However, Neo had his own foretelling from the Oracle that told him that either Morpheus or Neo would die, but that he had the choice to save himself or Morpheus. Neo and Trinity reenter the Matrix to make a daring and successful rescue of Morpheus. Neo saves Trinity from a helicopter crash, confirming Morpheus' belief that Neo is indeed The One of legend.Neo is eventually killed by Agent Smith shortly after the rescue, but reawakened as The One and returned to the Nebuchadnezzar before Sentinels can destroy the ship.In the second film, The Matrix Reloaded, Morpheus is more confident than ever that the war is nearing its end. A spiritual as well as an influential leader, Morpheus convinces one hovercraft ship to stay in the Matrix to await contact from the Oracle, despite orders from Zion for all ships to return to the city. He incurs the wrath of Jason Locke, commander of the Zion defensive forces, but Morpheus' actions are easily defended by Councillor Hamann, a member of the Zion Council, the city's ruling body.With the aid of Trinity and Niobe, Morpheus successfully retrieves The Keymaker, an exiled program that can access many hidden areas of the Matrix, including the Source, the central Machine City mainframe computer and programming heart of the Matrix. Morpheus aids Neo in successfully entering the door to the Source before returning to the Nebuchadnezzar.After Neo successfully enters the Source and returns from the Matrix with new information, he tells Morpheus that the Prophecy was a lie; it was another system of control that would bring The One to the Source to disseminate the programming inside Neo into the Matrix to allow a reboot, or reload of the Matrix, while Zion is destroyed and allowed to be rebuilt. The war is far from over. To make matters worse, a sudden Sentinel attack destroys the Nebuchadnezzar, further damaging Morpheus' belief in the outcome of the war. The crew is rescued by the hovercraft the Hammer commanded by Captain Roland, who joins forces with the Logos, commanded by Niobe.In the final film The Matrix Revolutions, Morpheus is somewhat dispirited, and has problems in understanding now what may truly happen to Zion and its people. Now without a ship of his own, he and Link (the Nebuchadnezzar's Operator) reside on the hovercraft Mjolnir, commanded by Roland. Morpheus renews his conviction that Neo could still save Zion, and reawakens Neo, whose mind is trapped in a computer netherworld called Mobil Avenue after Neo stopped five Sentinels in the real world just by thought at the end of The Matrix Reloaded. With the aid of Trinity and Seraph, he rescues Neo and returns his mind to the real world.Morpheus says farewell to Neo and Trinity a final time before they leave for the Machine City in the hovercraft Logos in a last-ditch attempt to stop the war. Morpheus aids Niobe as she flies the Mjolnir in a desperate ride back to Zion. The ship successfully stops the first onslaught of the Machine attack with the ship's electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapon.When the Sentinels suddenly stop a second wave of attacks, Morpheus instantly realizes that Neo is somehow fighting for them. When the Sentinels retreat after Neo successfully defeats the former Agent Smith, now a virus that threatened both man and Machine, Morpheus, and Niobe embrace in celebration as cheers arise from the Zion population, who have received a brokered peace through Neo's sacrifice. Morpheus' dream turned out to be right after all.Of the original Nebuchadnezzar crew in The Matrix, only Morpheus survives to see freedom for Zion.Referring back to the subjectivity of reality throughout the film trilogy, Morpheus' last lines in The Matrix Revolutions, said in disbelief as the Sentinels retreat from Zion, are \"Is this real?\"null","Like the series' other principal characters, Trinity is a computer programmer and a hacker who has escaped from the Matrix, a sophisticated computer program in which most of the human race is imprisoned. Though few specifics are revealed about her previous life inside the Matrix, we are told that Morpheus, one of a number of real-world hovercraft commanders, initially identified her and helped her escape from the program. At the beginning of the series, she is first mate on Morpheus' Nebuchadnezzar and serves mainly as a go-between for him and the individuals he wishes to free from the Matrix. As the series progresses, her primary importance as a character becomes her close relationship with Neo. She is skilled with computers, at operating vehicles both inside and outside the Matrix, and in martial arts.Throughout the series, her name is never revealed and is only referred to as Trinity.The Matrix:\nWe first meet Trinity at the beginning of The Matrix, in a phone conversation with Cypher, which is heard offscreen. This cuts to a dingy hotel room a chase scene between Trinity and a group of police officers and Agents, a series of programs that police the Matrix against rebels.Trinity is next seen communicating with Neo for Morpheus in several encounters. Eventually, she and the rest of the Nebuchadnezzar crew unplug Neo from the Matrix and begin his training as a new recruit in the war against the machines. She participates in several missions into the Matrix, including taking Neo to The Oracle, a computer program inside the Matrix who is said by the rebels to have supernatural powers.Throughout the film, it is apparent that Trinity has developed romantic feelings for Neo. Near the end of the film, after he is killed by Agent Smith in the Matrix, she speaks to his still-plugged-in body and reveals that the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with The One, a prophesied individual with superpowers inside the Matrix. She insists that he can't be dead, because her love for him proves that he is, in fact, The One, then kisses him, whereupon he miraculously wakes up. Neo defeats the Agents and the film ends.[1]This marks the beginning of a romantic relationship between Neo and Trinity which will prove decisive in the outcome of the series.The Matrix Reloaded:\nTrinity's importance as an individual character in the first sequel to The Matrix is fairly minimal for the first half of the film, though she appears in almost every scene. She aids in the rescue of the Keymaker from the Merovingian and in the subsequent escape, but her real role in the plot does not come into play until the climax of the story, where Neo is forced, at least ostensibly, to choose between saving Trinity and saving Zion, the underground city where the last humans not living in the Matrix reside. Motivated by his individual love for Trinity, where all of the five previous Ones were motivated by a profound general attachment to humanity as a whole, Neo chooses to save Trinity, and revives her after she is shot by an Agent.The Matrix Revolutions:\nIn the final installment of the Matrix series, Trinity is involved in the rescue of Neo from a cut-off segment of the Matrix, where he is being held by a program in the employ of the Merovingian. Later, back in the real world, Trinity goes with Neo to the Machine City in an attempt to negotiate with the Machines. While attempting to evade Machine pursuers, their hovercraft crashes violently. Trinity is impaled in several places by power cables and dies shortly thereafter.After Trinity's death, Neo finds the courage to make the final sacrifice for humanity, giving his life to defeat Smith and negotiate a truce with the Machines.Throughout the Matrix franchise, Trinity, like the other Matrix hackers, is shown to be highly competent at many skills both inside and outside the Matrix, including martial arts, computer use, the use of firearms and other weapons, and operating a range of motor vehicles.Trinity is seen to be especially skilled at the use of cars, motorcycles, and other vehicles, even in comparison to other hackers. In the first film, she pilots a Bell 212 helicopter and manages to maintain control even after its hydraulics system is damaged. In The Matrix Reloaded, she carries the Keymaker to safety on a Ducati 996 motorcycle in a harrowing chase through oncoming traffic.Combat, both armed and unarmed, is another area where Trinity, like her fellow crew members, excels.","Agent Smith is the antagonist in the film. He is part of a group of sentient artificially intelligent programs known as agents. The Agents are programs from the machine world that serve as the cleansers of the Matrix. Their purpose is to monitor the Matrix in search of programs that no longer serve a purpose or go rogue. Agents are superhuman beings in the Matrix possessing the ability to punch through concrete walls, move at impossible speeds, and jump large chasms effortlessly.We first meet Smith in the very beginning of the movie when he shows up to the Theatre where the police are prepared to capture Trinity. The camera assumes Smith to be the leader of the Agents because he approaches the officer in the front of the triangle of Agents. Throughout the rest of the film Smith is emphatically the most important Agent since he dominates the interactions with the characters throughout the film and films to come.Later in the movie, Smith's true colours are revealed in the scene with Morpeus in the Military Building. Off the record, Smith hates his role as the cleanser of the Matrix. He hates being in the Matrix and having to be the one that tries to hunt down the \"systemic anomoly\" (Neo) and exterminate him. \"You are the disease and we are the cure.\" Smith tells Morpeus. This first movie tells us only about Smith's general purpose which is to kill the inhabitants of Zion and exterminate the human race that is not plugged in. Smith's hatred toward humans is very general however, after the first movie Smith's goals narrow to something more specific which is the extermination of Neo and to take over the Machine world as well as the Matrix.Smith is the complete opposite of Neo. In the second movie, the Oracle explains to Neo that Smith is everything that Neo is not. She states that Smith is the result of the equation of the Matrix trying to balance itself out. Since Neo represents the good force in nature Smith is the evil force in nature. Thus giving equality to the equation of the matrix.In the end of the movie Smith kills Neo however Neo refuses to die and instead comes back to life and then defeats Smith by jumping into Smith which causes him to explode into fragments of green matrix material. Smith is not seen again until the second movie.","null","Cypher tells Trinity that she like to watch Neo. He later offers Neo a drink, regretting taking the blue pill. He mocks him for trying to save the world. He meets with Agent Smith at a restaurant, eating a steak and smoking a cigar, which prompts him declare that ignorance is bliss. He makes a deal to be reinserted into the Matrix in exchange for Morpheus. He wants to remember nothing and be a famous actor. Cypher leaves the Matrix and later trys to kill Tank & Dozer by electrocuting them, and unplugs Apoc and Switch, killing them as well. Tank is still alive and kills him.","Tank is Dozers little brother and was born outside the Matrix. An operator, he loads programs designed to teach Neo marshal arts.

When Gandalf comes to the Shire to tell Frodo the truth about the ring he inherited from his uncle Bilbo, he catches Sam eavesdropping, and orders him to go with Frodo on his journey. They are joined en route to Rivendell by Meriadoc \"Merry\" Brandybuck and Peregrin \"Pippin\" Took, two of Frodo's cousins, and Strider, a D\u00fanedain ranger of the North. At Rivendell, Frodo volunteers to take the Ring to Mount Doom to destroy it, and Sam volunteers to go with him. They are joined by the other hobbits and Strider, now revealed as Aragorn, last heir to the throne of Gondor, along with Gandalf, Gimli the Dward, Legolas the Elf, and Boromir, a man from Gondor, elder son of the Steward, Denethor II.Frodo ultimately decides that he must leave the Fellowship behind and continue on his own, but Sam insists on going with him. They soon capture Gollum and force him to act as their guide, though Sam is always suspicious of the wretched creature. His fears are later vindicated when Gollum leads Frodo into the lair of Shelob, a giant spider, hoping that Frodo will be killed and he could then take the Ring.Sam saves Frodo from Shelob, but Frodo has been stung by Shelob, and it appears to Sam as if he is dead. Later, when Orcs approach, Sam takes the Ring, and intends to go on alone, and complete the mission given to Frodo. However, he overhears the Orcs talking and discovers that Frodo isn't dead, simply paralyzed by Shelob's poison. The Orcs take Frodo to the tower of Cirith Ungol on the western border of Mordor, Sam following all the way. Sam rescues Frodo from the Orcs and returns the Ring to him, and they travel toward Mount Doom once again.Frodo grows progressively weaker under the influence of the Ring, and Sam's help is essential in getting him through Mordor to Mount Doom, once physically carrying him up the mountain until attacked by Gollum. There Frodo goes on alone, as Sam fends off Gollum. After seemingly defeating Gollum, he follows Frodo, urging him to throw the Ring into the fire, a scene shockingly similar to that which had happened 3000 years before, when Elrond told Isildur to destroy the Ring. Frodo decides to keep the Ring, and as he puts it on Sam is knocked out by Gollum, who then attacks Frodo, in a desperate fight to the death over possession of the ring. Sam watches the fight between them, until Frodo and Gollum topple over the precipice. Sam rescues Frodo, but Gollum and the ring perish in the volcano.At the end, Sam returned to the Shire, and married the one that he loved, Rosie Cotton, and they had many children: Elanor (named after the flower in Lorien), Goldilocks, Frodo, Pippin, Merry, Hamfast, Rose, and others. He continued to look after Frodo, particularly on the two days of year where he always fell ill, the day on which the ring perished, and the day on which he was pierced by the Morgul blade, until Frodo left for Valinor. He always felt somewhat guilty for his fame in Hobbiton, for he, Merry, and Pippin were hailed as heroes for saving the Shire from the \"Boss\", \"Sharkey\" aka Saruman, who had taken over the Shire. He felt Frodo deserved fame much more than he, but Frodo liked the anonymity.Sam was mayor of Hobbiton for many years. When Rosie died, he took a ship to Valinor (the Undying Lands), as he was himself a ring-bearer for a short while.","Madril is a high ranking ranger in service to Gondor.

Galadriel was the only woman to play a prominent role in the debate of the Noldor following the theft of the Silmarils, and, eager to return to Middle-earth, she was one of the leaders of the host of Fingolfin. Along with her uncle Feanor (the creator of the legendary Silmarils), she was considered the greatest of the Noldor and one of the greatest and most powerful Elves.In Middle-earth she dwealt with Finrod on Tol Sirion, but when her brother moved to Nargothrond, she went to Doriath, where she married Celeborn and was instructed in wisdom by Melian. She had one child, Celebrian. At the fall of Doriath she probably fled to Arvernien or the Mouths of Sirion. Galadriel was the only leader of the revolting Noldor to survive the Wars of Beleriand, and thus at the end of the First Age the ban of the Valar on her return to Valinor still remained.In the Second Age, Galadriel dwelt for a time in Lindon and Eregion (until its destruction by Sauron), and then became ruler of Lorien, which she made on the model of Doriath and the Girdle of Melian and sustained with the aid of her own power and that of Nenya, one of the Three Rings, which was given to her at its making. Throughout the Second and Third Ages Lorien remained safe from Sauron, for Galadriel's power was such that she knew his mind but hers was closed to him, and she could protect Lorien from assault by any power less than Sauron himself.During the War of the Ring, Galadriel gave shelter and great gifts to the Companions of the Ring, and she refused the One Ring when it was offered to her by Frodo. Because of this, and because of her endless opposition to Sauron, at the end of the Third Age the Valar permitted her to return to Valinor. Galadriel fulfilled her age-old desire in Third Age 3021, when she went over Sea with the Last Riding of the Keepers of the Rings.Galadriel was very tall and the greatest beauty of the house of Finwe; she had the golden hair of her mother's kindred.","Sindarin Elf of the Woodland Realm, son of Thranduil.

After the breaking of the Fellowship, Legolas went with Aragorn and Gimli in search of Merry and Pippin, and they fought in the Battle of the Hornburg at Helm's Deep. He was one of the Grey Company, and fought in the Battle of Pelennor Fields. While in Southern Gondor Legolas for the first time saw the Sea, and the Eldarin yearning for Eldemar was awakened in him.After the War of the Ring Legolas led a number of Elves of the Woodland Realm to Ithilien, where they beautified the war ravaged land. In Fourth Age 120, after the death of Elessar, Legolas finally sailed over Sea, taking Gimli with him.","Peregrin Took (nicknamed 'Pippin\") is a Took and that should be description enough. Tooks dwell in the Shire in Tookborough. They're set apart from the rest of Hobbits because of their inquisitiveness and adventuresome spirit. Pippin journeys with Frodo to Rivendell and becomes a member of the Fellowship of the Ring. He and his cousin Meriadoc (called \"Merry\") are later separated from the rest of the Fellowship by an attack at Parth Gallen where Boromir of Gondor falls trying to protect them. Pippin and Merry are then carried away by Orcs under the command of Saruman to bring any halflings to Isengard. He and the Fellowship are not fully reunited again (excluding Boromir of course) until the end of the trilogy.In the third part of the trilogy Pippins swears an oath to Lord Denethor II, the steward of Gondor. He does this out of guilt for the death of Boromir, Denethor's first and favorite son. He is later released from his oath when Denethor, believing his second son, Faramir, to be dead, tries to burn both himself and Faramir alive. Pippin knows that Faramir is alive and calls Gandalf for help. When Aragorn takes the throne, Pippin is brought under oath again and he fights in the Battle of Mordor as a knight of Gondor.Pippin and Merry were known for being troublemakers in the Shire. But when they returned, they (along with their cousin Frodo and friend Sam) became heroes after leading the rebellion against Saruman, who had taken over the Shire in their absence. Pippin married Diamond of Long Cleeve, when she was 32 and he was 37. They had one son, Faramir. Faramir Took later married Samwise Gamgee's daughter Goldilocks. He and Merry became the two tallest Hobbits in their history, having drank Ent-draught.

In Paris frequents the cafe \"La Belle Aurore\", run by a man he calls \"Frenchy\", and during this period he met Ilsa Lund, the love of his life. When the Germans marched into Paris he and Ilsa, along with Rick's trusted friend and piano player Sam, planned to run away to Marseillaise, but Ilsa left him stranded on the train station with only a note saying, \"I cannot go with you or ever see you again. You must not ask why. Just believe that I love you. Go, my darling, and God bless you. Ilsa.\"During this time (early December 1941) Rick sets up a cafe (\"Rick's Cafe Americaine\") in Casablanca, Morocco with Sam as his piano player. This cafe attracts the likes of refugees, Gestapo officers, pickpockets, and Resistance fighters. Heartbroken over losing Ilsa, Rick is turned from a passionate, political man to a cynical, neutral wreck who maintains short relationships and has no respect for women, as seen by his handling of current girlfriend Yvonne. His neutral political stance and his friendship with shady police officer Renault keep him out of trouble. When Rick stumbles into possession of letters of transit (thief Ugarte asked Rick to keep them for a short period of time but Ugarte was arrested shortly thereafter), which are signed by Charles de Gaulle and allow anybody to write their own ticket out of Casablanca without any question, his life is sent into a tailspin. Right as Ugarte is taken out of his cafe, in walk Resistance fighter Victor Lazlo....and his wife Ilsa. When Ilsa tries to explain everything, Rick won't listen to her and drunkenly denounces her as a whore. After Rick has heard the whole story, (Ilsa married Lazlo in secret; when he was taken to a concentration camp and presumed to be dead, Ilsa was hopeless until she met and fell in love with Rick. However, when it was revealed that Lazlo was still alive, Ilsa decided to stay with him--if she told Rick he would never have left Paris and jeopardized his life), Rick overcomes his heartbreak and, after much resistance, agrees to help get Lazlo out so that he can continue his work. Rick lets Ilsa believe that Lazlo will leave alone and she will stay with Rick; at the same time he lets Renault believe the same, and that this would be the perfect opportunity for Renault to arrest Lazlo on a legitimate charge. But while Renault is about to arrest Lazlo, Rick pulls out a gun and all 4 make it to the airport. It is here that Rick sacrifices his great love for something bigger and more important; he manipulates Ilsa into boarding a plane to Lisbon with her husband by telling her that she would be arrested if she stayed, that she would eventually regret it, that no matter what they will always remember their brief time in Paris. Lazlo and Ilsa safely board the plane and after Rick bravely shoots to death the evil Gestapo officer Major Strasser, the previously shady Renault and privately passionate Rick decide to fly to Brazzaville to join in the good fight, begining a beautiful friendship.","Ilsa Lund is a young woman fresh from her parent's home in Oslo. At the house of some friends, she meets a man about whom she'd heard her whole life--Victor Lazlo, a Czech Resistance fighter. He opens up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Believing that she loves him, she secretly marries him, and not even their closest friends know about their marriage. Lazlo fights the good fight, but is taken to a concentration camp. Ilsa is frantic, and a few months later she learns that Lazlo is dead. She is hopeless until she meets and falls in love with Richard \"Rick\" Blaine, an American cafe owner in Paris. When the Germans march into Paris, they both know that Rick must leave because of his political past. During their last few days a friend comes to Ilsa with good news: Lazlo is alive, but very sick. But now Ilsa is faced with the moral dilemma of being torn between two men, so she has to let Rick go. She leaves him at a train station with a note saying that though she cannot tell him anything, she loves him. Lazlo and Ilsa continue to fight the good fight, and they end up in unoccupied Morocco hoping to buy letters of transit from Ugarte so that they can board a plane to Lisbon and catch a plane to America to continue Lazlo's work. Thinking that they will make the deal in the cafe \"Rick's Cafe Americane,\" Lazlo is unpleasantly informed that Ugarte has been arrested, and Ilsa makes a discovery that Rick owns the cafe, and instead of the passionate man she once loved, he has turned into a drunken, heartbroken mess. When she tries to explain everything, she is drunkenly denounced as a whore. The next day, word gets out that Ugarte is dead, but that the letters of transit were not found on his body...it is believed that Rick has them. However, Rick will not yield the letters to Lazlo's money, nor when Ilsa holds a gun to his stomach. When Ilsa reveals the truth, Rick agrees to help them; he lets Ilsa believe that Lazlo will leave with the letters of transit, and she will stay with him. However, when they get to the airport, Rick manipulates her into boarding the plane with her husband, saying that she will surely be arrested, that she will regret it, etc. Ilsa boards the plane to Lisbon with Lazlo, presumably to America.","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Annina Brandel is a young Bulgarian woman married to Jan.

One of these scams, according to a shady lawyer named \"Kobayashi,\" whom ended in the loss of 50,000+ dollars that belonged to the legendary underworld kingpin, Keyser Soze. It was because of this debt to Soze that Kint was supposedly recruited along with a small crew of other criminals into an elaborate plot to help Soze. The plot involved them hijacking a boat and destroying the cocaine onboard. Once aboard, the criminals found that there was no cocaine, and that there was another game afoot. All of the criminals were killed, except for Kint, who stayed behind, and a Hungarian mob member, who was horribly injured when the boat was set ablaze by Keyser Soze himself.Kint is shown to be crippled, suffering from cerebral palsy.

Jones is notable for his trademark bullwhip, fedora, leather jacket, and fear of snakes.\nHe is also the son of Professor Henry Jones, Sr. In his younger days, Henry, Jr. was in the Boy Scouts, and that is where he found a love of Archaeology, trying to recover the Cross of Coronado from people whom he suspected to be grave robbers. It was later found that those gentlemen had the land and its caves fair and square. During the ensuing chase, Indy Develops his fear of Snakes and quickly masters a Bull-whip as he goes face to face with a Lion on a circus train. Later, Dr. Henry Jones Jr. would recover the Cross of Coronado from the same man and donate it to a museum as an important historic artifact (in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade).\nIndiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood Williams has a son named Henry Jones III (a.k.a. Mutt Williams).The nickname \"Indiana\" is said to have come from the name of a dog (at the end of the second to last sequel \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" the character of Sean Connery reveals that \"Indiana\" was the name of their dog).The character is most famously played by Harrison Ford; however, he has also been portrayed by River Phoenix (as the young Indiana in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade), Corey Carrier, Sean Patrick Flanery, and George Hall (The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles).In addition to his film and television appearances, the character has been featured in novels, comics, role playing games, video games, and other media.","Marion Ravenwood was born in 1909 and first met Indiana Jones through her missing father, Dr. Abner Ravenwood, who has mysteriously disappeared. Abner was also an archaeologist and once took Indiana under his wing, until Abner found out about Indy and Marion's relationship. Dr. Jones abandoned Marion and Abner for ten years, until he resumed his relationship with Marion while pursuing the Ark of the Covenant.Marion, in the meantime, was the owner of a seedy bar, The Raven, located in Nepal, where she kept the Headpiece to the Staff of Ra, an instrumental object in locating the Ark, given to her by her father, which she called \"my medallion\".Since Indy and Marion's pursuit and eventual location of the Ark, extensive details about her are unknown, but we know she married Colin Williams after Indy left her pregnant with a son named Henry \"Mutt\" Jones III. Marion began dating Colin when Mutt was just 3 months old.Marion and Indiana Jones got married in 1957.","Dr. Rene Belloq is a rival archeologist and the arch nemesis to Indiana Jones. In the opening teaser of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", Belloq manipulates the local tribes to hold Indy at arrow point while he steals the priceless idol that Jones had successfully acquired at the risk of losing his life. Belloq reminds Jones that there is \"nothing he can possess that he cannot take away.\"Later in the film, it is revealed that the Nazi-Archeological expedition to Cairo, in search of the Ark of the Covenant, is being led by Belloq himself. After a game of cat and mouse, Marion Ravenwood, Indy's love interest, ends up in Gestapo custody. Belloq takes a liking to her, and begins wooing her to add insult to injury for his arch rival.Once unearthed, the Ark begins switching masters back and forth between Indiana and the Nazis, before it is finally opened by Belloq amidst an ancient ritual. Belloq's hubris gets the better of him as he stares deep into the Ark after it is opened. As a result, he and the rest of the Nazi expedition are destroyed by the power of the Ark in a gruesome manner. They are sucked into the confines of the Ark, and never seen again.","Major Arnold Toht, of the SS, is a sinister agent assigned by the Fuhrer to assist his principal agent, Dietrich, in recovery of the Ark of the Covenant. Toht is extremely ruthless and willing to resort to true SS-style torture in order to get results (such as use of a white-hot poker). In his zeal to obtain the Ark, he is even willing to take personal risks - in one instance he is burned by a red-hot medallion that he was trying to recover. However, he is grossly ignorant of the Ark's power and does not think it will turn on the Nazis. He will pay for that ignorance in a horrific way, as the Ark turns its furies & ghosts on the Nazi defilers & Belloq, eliminating them in terrifying ways.","Sallah is Dr. Indiana Jones' beloved and trusted friend.

Norman is a fat, middle-aged drunkard who has an unnaturally close relationship with his mother. He runs the motel his mother owns. But Mother is insane; and when she suspects Norman of desiring an attractive young guest, she sneaks into the girl's room and stabs her to death as she showers. Norman covers up the murder; but Mother soon kills a private investigator hired to find the girl.We learn at the end that \"Mother\" is Norman himself who developed a split personality after murdering his real mother and her lover in a fit of jealousy. Unable to bear the guilt, he took on her personality to persuade himself that she was still alive. Even more ghoulishly, he stole her corpse and preserved it, which helped maintain the illusion she was still living in their house by the motel.The above also describes the character and predicament of the cinematic Norman in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960), but for one key difference. At the suggestion of his scenarist, Joseph Stefano, Hitchcock cast the young, boyishly handsome Anthony Perkins, a leading heartthrob at the time, in the role of Norman Bates. Perkins's charm and good looks made it easier for Hitchcock to conceal his surprise ending, which reveals the true nature of the troubled young man. He doesn't drink (as far as we know), but he's no less a psychopath than his literary counterpart.We meet Norman when an attractive girl (Janet Leigh) checks into his motel. We find this shy, nervous young man is lonely. He invites the girl to have supper with him at his house, which is right next to the motel. But Mother is having none of it. We don't see Mother, of course; but we hear \"her\" shouting from the forbidding Victorian house. Norman returns to the girl and, knowing she must have heard the shouting, apologizes. \"Mother--what is the phrase? She isn't quite herself today.\"Instead, the two of them have supper in a parlor behind the office. Norman tells her that the motel gets few guests because the main highway was moved. He's mostly alone with his mother, a situation he clearly regrets. We find that Norman is an amateur taxidermist, a fact confirmed by the stuffed birds that decorate the parlor. He likes to stuff birds because they're passive creatures. He couldn't bear to stuff more aggressive animals, like foxes, chimps, dogs, etc.Norman's own passive behavior switches suddenly to anger when the conversation turns back to his mother, and the girl suggests that he have her put away in an institution. Outraged and almost frightened, he tells her that his mother is not insane: \"She just goes a little mad sometimes.\" He quickly regains his composure.The girl is ready to return to her room. Norman asks if she'd like to stay and talk some more, but she begs off. He has forgotten--or pretends to have forgotten--her name, and she reminds him: it's Miss Crane. But Norman checks the register again and is amused to find that it says \"Marie Samuels.\"Norman has a creepy habit. Once \"Marie\" is in her room, which is right next to the parlor, he watches her through a peephole as she takes off her clothes. After getting his fill of her nude body, he goes back to the house. Soon he returns to the motel and sneaks into her room as she showers. Now, dressed in his mother's clothes and wielding a knife, he believes he is Mother, avenging \"herself\" against the slut who is trying to seduce \"her\" son. \"Mother\" stabs the girl to death with a kitchen knife and runs out of the room.Norman switches back to his own personality, \"sees\" that his mother is covered in blood and runs back to the motel. His fears are confirmed. The girl is dead, and \"Mother\" has killed her.Like the dutiful son, he covers up the crime. He wraps the corpse in the shower curtain, puts it in the trunk of the girl's car along with all her other belongings and drives the car out to a swamp. He sinks the car and returns home.Later, a private investigator named Arbogast (Martin Balsam) shows up at the motel. He's looking for the girl, whose real name is Marion Crane. Norman tries to get rid of him, but is forced to admit that Marion had spent the night at the motel recently. Arbogast wants to speak to Norman's mother, whom he sees sitting near a window of the house. Little does he know, this old woman is only a corpse.Arbogast finally leaves, but predictably, returns. He sneaks into the house, hoping to find Mrs. Bates. Norman knows this man is dangerous to him. He switches over to his Mother personality, then finds Arbogast at the top of the stairs where he stabs him with his kitchen knife. Arbogast stumbles down the stairs. Norman meets him at the bottom of the staircase and stabs him to death. Arbogast's last sight is that of Norman dressed as the woman he had been looking for and surely regrets finding.Norman once again covers up the crime he believes his mother has committed. He hides his Mother--again, just her corpse--in the fruit cellar. \"She\" protests, but Norman picks her up against her will and carries her into the basement. Despite her proven ability to overpower and kill men and women alike, she is unable to resist.Norman, as he expected, soon has more visitors. They claim to be a married couple wanting a room for the night, but Norman doesn't buy it, especially since the woman looks so much like his last guest. He may well suspect who they are, but he never learns for certain. But we already know: they're Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) and Marion's boyfriend Sam (John Gavin).Soon, Sam visits Norman in his office, claiming that his wife is resting and that he would like to chat. Sam's small talk quickly turns into hostile interrogation before letting slip a hint--which Norman immediately deciphers--that Lila is in the house looking for Mother.Norman and Sam struggle. Norman grabs a vase and knocks Sam out cold, then runs to the house. He doesn't immediately go looking for Lila. First he dons his mother's personality and dresses in her clothes. He finds Lila in the fruit cellar and intends to stab her with his knife. But Sam has revived in time to run to the house and overpower Norman before he can.Norman never hears the explanation for his crimes that we hear from the psychiatrist who examines him. We can judge ourselves how accurate the doctor's judgment is. One thing is certain: Norman is gone and \"Mother\" has taken over.The doctor predicts this development is permanent. When Anthony Perkins returns to his role in Psycho II (1983), we learn this is not true. Norman is indisputably back, but by the end of the film so is Mother.","What a weekend that was, Lila always hates when she has to go out of town to buy. Not that she would have done much if she had stayed here, Marion has been acting crazy lately. She acts like she's thinking of someone and occassionally she'll phone someone at the latest hours. It's as if she's hiding something from Lila, but what? She must be seeing someone, but that gives her no reason to hide. Maybe whomeever she's seeing is where she spent the night because she still hasn't come home yet. She's even late to work, they've already phones Lila and asked if she were ill. Doesn't make any sense for her to just not come home and leave no note or anything. Lila told Mr. Lowry that she'd check into it, but maybe she'll just go wait for Marion down at her office. Lila's going to figure out what Marion is up to one way or another even if she has to kill her to do it...","null","Marion Crane began her (brief) life as Mary Crane, the ill-fated heroine of Robert Bloch's novel, Psycho. We meet Mary when she arrives at the Bates Motel, exhausted and badly in need of a night's rest. She doesn't get it.As part of the novel is told from her point of view, we learn that she has a secret. She's stolen money from her boss and is now in flight. She's traveled by car a long way from Phoenix to meet her boyfriend in a small town called Fairvale. This is her first (and last) stop for lodgings. She plans to surprise her boyfriend, make some excuse for why she has the money and finally wed the man whose financial situation has prevented him from agreeing to marriage.The shy, nervous proprietor of the motel is Norman Bates. Bates offers her supper in a parlor behind his office. He's lonely and grateful for conversation. He's also dominated by a mother whom he reveals is insane. Mary pities the pathetic Bates, trapped by circumstances outside of his control. She realizes in talking to him that she is about to step into her own trap. She decides to return the money.She goes to her room and takes a shower, which feels to her like absolution. But it's too late for that. Bates's insane mother enters the bathroom carrying a kitchen knife, which she uses to stab Mary to death.Or so it seems. At the end of the novel we learn that \"Mother\" is Bates himself, afflicted with a mental disease that has given him a split-personality. Bates's mother is long dead, the victim of Norman's matricide.We spend a relatively brief time with Mary before she is dispatched. When Joseph Stefano began adapting the novel for Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 shocker, Psycho, he suggested to Hitchcock that the story should focus on Mary (who has been renamed Marion). Shocking as Mary's death was to readers, moviegoers would be far more shocked. Marion would be played by a star (Janet Leigh). No one would expect that the leading lady would be murdered less than halfway through the film.The movie opens with Marion and her boyfriend, Sam Loomis (John Gavin), at the end of their lunchtime tryst in a cheap hotel. She's unhappy having to meet Sam in such a place for a quick coupling. She wants to be his wife. Sam reminds her how impossible this is. He's paying alimony to his ex-wife; he's paying off his dead father's debts; he's struggling as the manager of a hardware store in a small town called Fairvale. The two of them couldn't get by. Later, Marion's frustration leads her into a rash act.She returns from her tryst with Sam to the office where she works as a secretary. We see the circumstances that conspire to trick her into justifying a foolish decision. She works for a real estate agent, Mr. Lowery (Vaughn Taylor), who air conditions his inner room while allowing his two secretaries to swelter in the outer office. The other secretary, Caroline (Patricia Hitchcock), brags about her own marriage. In walks Mr. Lowery and his client, an oilman named Tom Cassidy (Frank Albertson), who brags about his own wealth, boasts that he cheats on his taxes and makes a drunken pass at her while waving his money in the air, announcing that he never carries more than he can afford to lose. He's carrying $40,000 in cash, with which he intends to pay Lowery for his services.This makes Lowery nervous. He asks Marion to take the money directly to the bank; he doesn't want it in the office overnight. Would that he had kept it there, for his sake, his client's and especially Marion's. The money tempts her to folly. Instead of taking it to the bank, she brings it back to her apartment, where she packs up her things and then flees in her car, intending to drive all the way to Fairvale, where she'll tell Sam some story as to why she suddenly has all this money. The money, she thinks, will allow Sam to marry her.Along the way to Fairvale, she nearly falls asleep at the wheel. She takes a quick nap in her car, but soon finds a motorcycle cop (Mort Mills) tapping on her door and waking her up. This terrifies her, and the cop becomes suspicious. Unable to find any grounds for holding her, he allows her to go.Marion stops at a used car lot to trade in her car for another and thus cover her tracks. Her insistence on quickly making the trade unsettles the salesman (John Anderson); but California Charlie, as he calls himself, can find no reason to deny her the trade, even after she suspiciously avoids haggling over the price: $700 plus her car. Marion's anxiety increases when she sees that the patrolman has parked across the street. He seems to be watching her.Marion makes it out of the car lot, but knows she has aroused suspicions, especially since she paid for the car in cash. A rainstorm comes, making it nearly impossible to drive. She loses her way off the main road and fatefully winds up blinking up at a neon sign that says \"Bates Motel\" and \"Vacancy.\"She stops at the motel and runs to the office, where she finds no one. There's a forbidding, Gothic house next to the motel. She sees an old woman passing by a window and, assuming the manager must live there, returns to her car and honks her horn to announce her arrival.A young man comes running out of the house, holding an unopened umbrella. He opens it when he gets to Marion's car and leads her back into the office. She asks if there's a vacancy. The young proprietor, who introduces himself as Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), tells her there is: \"Twelve, in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.\" He gives her cabin one, explaining that it's closer, in case she needs anything. She tells him she needs sleep more than anything--and maybe food. He invites her to have supper with him in this house; but after he goes to make preparations, she hears the raving voice of an old woman all the way from the house to her cabin, where she is unpacking (and wrapping her money in a newspaper in order to hide it). The evidently lunatic mother is arguing with her son Norman and refusing to allow the woman into her home, insinuating that this unwanted guest only wants to seduce her erring boy.Norman returns to the motel with a tray of food and apologizes to Marion for his mother's behavior. He takes her into his parlor behind the office, where she eats the supper as he sits and makes conversation. The poor young man is clearly lonely and pathetically eager for any small talk. He tells her about his unhappy life, including the hobby that fills his time, rather than passes it: taxidermy. The parlor is filled with stuffed birds.His conversation is innocuous, if rather sad, although it takes one dark turn. She makes the mistake of suggesting that he put his mother, who dominates him and makes his life miserable, into an institution. He becomes livid, sputtering that his mother \"is not a maniac, a raving thing; she just goes a little mad sometimes.\" She apologizes and he quickly recovers. In spite of this, it's clear she likes and pities Norman.By this point, the audience (especially the original, unwary 1960 audience) may suspect the possibility of romance between Marion and the strange, but sympathetic and boyishly handsome Norman, a thought that would not have occurred to readers of the novel, whose Norman Bates is a fat, unappealing man in his forties. The audience has already been led to doubt the true feelings of Marion's boyfriend, Sam. But the possibility of romance proves to be a horrific joke.Her encounter with Norman has shown her the folly of her criminal act. Should she follow through with it, she would wind up in \"a private trap,\" just like Norman. She decides to return the money, but it's too late. Later in her cabin, she suffers the same fate as her literary counterpart: stabbed to death in the shower by Norman in drag. Marion fares negligibly better than Mary, whose stabbings were so brutal that they removed her head. Marion keeps her head, but just as surely loses her life. Her body, and the money she stole (still concealed in the LA Times), wind up in the trunk of her car, which Norman, the dutiful son covering up the crime \"Mother\" committed, pushes into a nearby swamp.Marion of course is missing from the many sequels to Psycho, except in flashback in Psycho II (1983); but she returns in Gus Van Sant's 1998 remake of Hitchcock's classic. The 1990s Marion (Anne Heche) seems more flippant and less anxiety-ridden than her predecessor, but winds up just as dead.","In the movie, he goes only by his last name -- \"Arbogast\" -- and he has about 20 minutes of screen time and five scenes, all pretty unforgettable. He is a private investigator based out of Phoenix, Arizona, who follows the trail of missing embezzler Marion Crane to her boyfriend's northern California hometown of Fairvale, and then on to the last place Marion was seen by anyone...the Bates Motel, on the Old Highway, managed by young Norman Bates and overseen by his Mother's Gothic mansion. The amiable, sly Arbogast has a few questions for Norman.\nAnd then a few more for Mrs. Bates, who is waiting for him in her room at the top of the mansion stairs. The Balsam version is definitive -- crisp vocals, suave manner, and a great open-mouthed shock-face for his showdown with Mother; Macy was good but physically miscast and poorly attired in a ridiculous hat.","Al Chambers (John McIntire), the old sheriff of a small town called Fairvale, proves himself unequal to the task of helping Sam Loomis and Lila Crane solve a mystery in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960).Sam (John Gavin), who owns the local hardware store, and Lila (Vera Miles), the sister of Sam's girlfriend Marion, come to Sheriff Chambers for help. Marion has disappeared and so has the private investigator sent to find her. They're certain that something sinister is going on at the local Bates Motel, where both missing persons were last heard from. Chambers takes the matter lightly. He's certain that Marion is in hiding (she had stolen money from her boss); and he guesses the P.I. is hot on her trail. Chambers investigates at the motel and talks to the proprietor Norman Bates, but discovers nothing.Sam and Lila want to know about Norman's sick old mother, whom the P.I. had told them he wanted to question. Chambers informs them that Norman Bates's mother is long-dead. Ten years before, she had poisoned her lover to death with strychnine and then committed suicide by drinking some of it herself. Later we learn that's not quite what had happened. Chambers had failed to learn the truth ten years before and he fails to learn it in this case. It's up to Sam and Lila to find out what happened at the Bates Motel, and it's far worse than Chambers or they could have suspected.Philip Baker Hall plays Chambers in Gus Van Sant's scene-for-scene remake, Psycho (1998).","null","null","null","null","null","California Charlie is a used car salesmen. He operates a car dealership outside of Los Angles. We meet him while he sells a car to Marion Crane. Charlie is a bright fellow who brings a smile to our face.","An unnamed highway patrolman (Mort Mills) becomes the nemesis of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), the heroine of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960).The patrolman spots Marion's car parked along the side of the highway. He parks his motorcycle next to it and sees a sleeping Marion lying across the front seat. He taps on her window; she sees him and panics. This arouses his suspicions, which remain even after she calms down. She tries to explain that she had only pulled over for a moment to take a quick nap after nearly falling asleep at the wheel. He examines her driver's license, but can find no reason to hold her. She drives off, but he follows covertly until he sees her stop at a used car lot. He parks across the street and just stands there and watches. He (presumably) notices that she spots him and keeps looking back at him nervously. He rides into the parking lot just as she's about to drive off in her newly-bought car. His presence is clearly upsetting her: she almost forgets the luggage she had left in her old car.We never see the patrolman's eyes, which are hidden by his sunglasses. This gives him an air of menace; but the patrolman could have been Marion's greatest friend. Had he discovered her secret that she had just stolen money from her boss in Phoenix and was fleeing to be with her boyfriend, he could have prevented her from ending up at the Bates Motel where an insane \"old woman\" stabs her to death in the shower. As usual in a Hitchcock film, the police are useless. See Sheriff Chambers for further confirmation on that point.James Remar plays the patrolman in Gus Van Sant's scene-for-scene remake, Psycho (1998)."],"ImageURL":["http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTI4NTIxNTgzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTkyNTQ2._V1._SX450_SY320_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTgwMjg0MTQyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODM0NTY3._V1._SX512_SY413_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTQwODMxMjg1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDM0NTY3._V1._SX411_SY512_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTI5ODM3MTY1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzYwOTQ3MQ@@._V1._SX640_SY800_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTkzODEyMTQzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTkyNTQ2._V1._SX450_SY343_.jpg","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"],"Name":["Norman Bates","Lila Crane","Sam Loomis","Marion Crane","Det.

He is selfless and honorable. He is deaf in one ear after rescuing his brother from falling into a frozen lake.","Mary Hatch is one of the most famous female characters in movie history. She grows up with George Bailey as the little sister of one of his childhood friends. She has loved him for years. When they are both young, Mary whispers into George's deaf ear (he lost his hearing in the ear after jumping into an icy river to save his brother Harry's life), \"George Bailey, I will love you 'till the day you die.\" They get reacquainted as young adults at a high school dance. George begins to return her affection in a scene where he tells Mary he will pull the moon down with a lasso.Mary is bubbly, smart, deeply goodhearted, and not without a clever streak. Though she is in most ways the definition of a proper lady, she has a lighthearted spirit and occasionally enjoys being shocking. At first, George doesn't want Marys affections, though he cares for her deeply. He has never wanted the married life, and has always snobbishly seen it as best fit for those with no other ambition. However, he cant stay away from her. In one scene, he walks into Marys mothers home to visit her, but wont admit that he desperately wants to see her and shuffles around her house aimlessly, grumbling in disgust of his own weakness. Mary is being courted by a wealthy suitor named Sam, someone her mother loves, and when her mother demands to know what George Bailey is doing in the house, Mary calls out, \"Hes making violent love to me, Mother!\" and enjoys the look of embarrassment on Georges face. Near the end of the scene, George holds Mary's arms very tightly and tells her that he never wants to get married. Mary starts to cry because of the way George is lashing out at her. George notices that Mary is crying and stops and kisses her on the lips.A few months later, they get married in Bedford Falls and plan to leave for a honeymoon in Europe, but it never happens as there is trouble in the Building and Laws building George and his uncle own. After people threaten to go and put their money in the bank, which George doesn't want them to do, Mary gives George their honeymoon money to loan to their customers. Later that evening, George is welcomed into his new house, the Old Granville house, where George and Mary went after their high school dance and threw stones at the windows to make a wish. The house they are now living in is falling apart with holes all over the place where water is rushing in from the rain outside. As George and Mary kiss, their friends Bert and Ernie Bishop sing \"I Love You Truly\" in the rain. In the next few years, George and Mary work on repairing the house.Mary becomes a housewife, as George stays at his job at the Building and Loan Association. Over the years, Mary and George have four children (Pete, Janie, Tommy, and Zuzu). Mary becomes a volunteer for the war effort and makes as many contributions to the community as she can. George can't go to war because of his deaf ear, but stays in Bedford Walls as an Air-Raid Warden. Near the end of the movie, George becomes very depressed and thinks about committing suicide after his uncle misplaces $8,000. This loss will put George and his uncle in prison if they don't come up with the money. George's guardian angel then shows George how brilliant his life is and how much he should appreciate Mary.Mary gets very worried that George has disappeared and gets her family and friends to collect enough money to pay off the $8,000 his uncle lost (Mr. Potter actually has the money, which George's uncle, misplaced in his newspaper, but doesn't return it in the hope that they will go to jail). George is reunited with his family and enjoys Christmas Eve with his family and friends.\"Written by Morgan Rhys\"null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","She's a peach."],"ImageURL":["http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTIwMzIyODg0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDQzNTU2._V1._SX450_SY301_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTU3NTc1OTY4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTUwMTExNA@@._V1._SX640_SY822_.jpg","null","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjAxMDU1NjEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODMzNTU2._V1._SX450_SY303_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjEyNDI2NDg4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjExOTM2._V1._SX362_SY450_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjAxMDU1NjEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODMzNTU2._V1._SX450_SY303_.jpg","null","null","null","null","null","null","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjAxMDU1NjEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODMzNTU2._V1._SX450_SY303_.jpg","null","null"],"Name":["George Bailey","Mary Hatch","Henry F.

As the film progresses, Mathilda implores L\u00e9on to teach her his trade in order to kill Stansfield and avenge the murder of her younger brother.Stansfield wears a beige suit, and is unshaven with often unkempt hair. He has been described as a psychopath, and as having an unhinged, unpredictable personality; he has also been cited for his charm, however. He is a classical music purist who likens his killings to the works of Beethoven. Throughout the film, he takes an unidentified drug in capsule form, which causes exaggerated physical contortions and heavy breathing, and apparent feelings of blissfulness.","Mathilda is a main character within Leon; she is a twelve year old girl with mental issues who travels with Leon himself. During the beginning of the film we see how Mathilda is treated by her family, which is poorly; the only strong attachment she seems to hold is that between her and her little brother. Mathildas family is killed and Mathilda moves in with Leon (her neighbour at the time) who teaches her how to be an assassin so she can get revenge on the man who killed her brother.\nAt many points in the film it is hard to tell whether the character is a child or a woman, because of the way she behaves and how she dresses. She is often found behaving in an adult manner (bringing the shopping in, looking after her brother, acting calmly in stressful situations etc.) but also she is seen watching cartoons and arguing with her sister. The way she dresses often depicts adulthood, because she is shown wearing a choker, boots and a short skirt.

Memorable Quotes\n\nBiography\nDesmond was once a giant of the silver screen's silent era, but the proliferation of talking pictures marked the end of her career as a big time Hollywood star. She lives a reclusive existence in her lavish Beverly Hills mansion on Sunset Boulevard with her servant, and former film director, Max von Mayerling (portrayed by Erich von Stroheim) and pet monkey. It is the death of her monkey that serves as a source of confusion between the main characters at the onset of the film. A struggling screenwriter named Joe Gillis (portrayed by William Holden) arrives at Desmond's home after his car gets a flat tire and he pulls into her garage. Desmond thinks that Gillis is an undertaker, who has come to make funeral arrangements for her recently deceased pet. When the matter is cleared up, Desmond's interest is piqued by Gillis' profession and she asks him to review a manuscript she has been preparing based on the legendary tale of Salome and the dance of the seven veils. It is her hopes that the script will serve as a starring vehical for her major big screen comeback. Gillis accepts the proposition and quickly becomes the faded star's kept man. Desmond schemes to get the script into the hands of renowned filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille (portrayed by himself) for Paramount Pictures to produce. The once-famous actress is misled into thinking Mr. DeMille is interested in working with her again, but in truth he wants to use her vintage car, a 1929 Isotta Fraschini, in his current period epic. It is Max who lies to Norma Desmond about Mr. DeMille's intentions in order to keep her happy and in denial about her fallen status. His actions, however misguided they may seem, stem from his admiration for her, as it is later revealed he was also her first husband.History\nThe role of Norma Desmond was initially offered to Mae West (who also kept monkeys as pets), Mary Pickford (who demanded Wilder make too many script changes), and Pola Negri (who also lived in seclusion and, like Mae West, rejected the role) before it was accepted by Gloria Swanson. Swanson almost turned down the role after Billy Wilder requested she do a screen test for it.Director George Cukor reportedly suggested Gloria Swanson for the role of Norma Desmond. He told her, \"If they want you to do ten screen tests, do ten screen tests. If you don't, I will personally shoot you.\" Swanson reluctantly agreed to the test, and got the role.Trivia\nPhotographs of the young Norma Desmond that appear throughout her house are all genuine publicity photos from Gloria Swanson's early years as an actress.The name Norma Desmond is thought to be a combination of two well-known figures from the silent film period: actress Norma Talmadge and director William Desmond Taylor.According to Gloria Swanson's daughter, her mother stayed in character throughout the entire shoot.Norma Desmond's iconic scene in which she descends down the staircase was performed while Gloria Swanson was barefoot. The steps were too narrow for the actress to navigate in heels and, she was terrified of tripping and falling. She is said to have burst into tears upon completion of the scene.Memorable Quotes\n\"All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up\" (Voted as the #7 movie quote by the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes.) http:\/\/www.afi.com\/tvevents\/100years\/quotes.aspx\"I am big!

He also directed many of her early films. He ranked, by his own admission, along with such greats as DeMille and D.W.Griffith. Ultimately, he served as her Butler, protector and enabler of her delusional world played out in a faded Hollywood Mansion. Max was a hopeless romantic encased in a rigid, austere shell. His feelings only escape when he remembers her glory days in the movie through his dialogue and in the play through his songs, \"Greatest Star of All\" and \"New Ways to Dream\".

They constantly arm wrestle with local blacks with Derek actually winning the local basketball court rights, after beating them in a game thereby enhancing his position as the leader of his group (encouraged by Stacy Keachs character Alexander who conveniently stays in the background when Derek's group runs amok).The sporting rivalry goes up a few notches when Derek catches two black men, one a basketball player no longer allowed on the court, trying to steal the family car. He kills them both violently and ends up in prison. He teams up with the Aryan's in prison but becomes disillusioned when they do drug business with minority groups. He makes this point to them and he is beaten and raped as revenge. Keeping himself to himself, he is eventually befriended by a black convict who saved him from being a target of the black gangs behind barsUpon his release his major task is to rid his younger brother Danny of becoming like he used to be. He breaks from Alexanders grip but Danny is a little less inclined. Danny is a smart kid who is still lives in the shadow of his brothers' past exploits. This is probably to blame for his murder by a black kid in the school toilets. This further shows Derek the needless waste of life based on antagonistic, racist belief and as he learned in prison, the belief is often enticed by things it is supposed to detest, in this case, open business with minorities.Derek was greatly influenced by his father. In the film, shown through flashback we see Dereks father and they were sitting around eating dinner. Derek mentions Mr. Sweeney and how he was black and how Mr. Sweeney had 2 PhDs and that he had them reading black literature. Dereks dad says Oh is it Black History Month. Soon there after his dad goes off and starts talking about how the force hired two black men over a white man who scored higher than them because of Affirmative Action. From this we learn that Dereks racism stems deeply from his father, perhaps a reflection of how so many people inherit their beliefs from their parents.","Danny emulates his older brother, adopting a skinhead mentality. He thinks nothing of confronting a group of black students in the school lavatory. When assigned to write a paper on a civil rights leader, Danny submits one about Adolf Hitler. His teacher turns to Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks), the principal, for help. Sweeney asks Danny to submit another report for their private seminar to be called American History X. The topic is to be his brother, Derek. Unknown to Danny, Sweeney has been visiting Derek in prison. Under his guidance, Derek has abandoned his radical views and now rejects hate groups. When he is released from prison, Derek is greeted as a hero by other members of the hate group, including their remote charismatic leader, Cameron (Stacy Keach). In a private meeting, Derek rejects Cameron and his neo-Nazi philosophy.First he is reluctant to change his attitudes, but very quickly he agrees and is easily influenced by his brother. The influence that Derrick has over his brother is amazing. He can make Daniel do almost anything that he wills; even immediately change his attitudes, although it took Derrick several years in prison, and several life altering events in prison to make that change himself.","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"],"ImageURL":["http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTMxMDY3MDA0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjIxODY3Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY427_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNjg5MTEwNjY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTIxODY3Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY960_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTI0Mzc3MzczOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTU5OTc2._V1._SX640_SY428_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTI0Mzc3MzczOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTU5OTc2._V1._SX640_SY428_.jpg","null","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTUzODcwMDAxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTU5OTc2._V1._SX488_SY729_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTM3OTgxODQ5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzQ5OTc2._V1._SX640_SY429_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTMxMDY3MDA0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjIxODY3Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY427_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTk3MzM4OTIwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTQ5OTc2._V1._SX640_SY428_.jpg","null","null","null","null","null","null"],"Name":["Derek Vinyard","Danny Vinyard","Doris Vinyard","Davina Vinyard","Seth Ryan","Stacey","Dr. Bob Sweeney","Murray","Cameron Alexander","Dennis Vinyard","Lamont","Rasmussen","Little Henry\n\n                \n                (as Jason Bose-Smith)","Lawrence","Mitch McCormick"]},"33":{"Actor":[],"Bio":[],"ImageURL":[],"Name":[]}},"Link":"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0120586\/","Title":"American History X"},{"Characters":{"0":{"Actor":["Marlon Brando","Martin Sheen","Robert Duvall","Frederic Forrest","Sam Bottoms","Laurence Fishburne","Albert Hall"],"Bio":["null","null","null","null","Apocalypse Now (1979)Lance is a famous surfer from the beaches south of Los Angeles, California.

He is also the secret identity of the crime-fighting Vigilante known as the Batman.Bruce Wayne was raised in the fictional city of Gotham where has parents owned Wayne Enterprises, employing some 170,000 people. When Bruce was a young boy he witnessed the tragic murder of his parents, by the criminal Joe Chill, late one night after leaving a theater (where the movie \"Zorro\" was playing). He was put in the custody of the Wayne family butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Bruce grew up enraged and traumatized by his parents death. Years later when Wayne was in his early 20's, he took to crime fighting as a way to deal with his anger, as well as avenge his parents. One evening whilst brooding over his inability to intimidate criminals, a bat came flying through the window of his study at stately Wayne Manor. This event sparked the idea of donning a frightening bat-like costume. The concept of a bat-themed suit resonated with Bruce due to his childhood fear of bats and the memory of his father wearing a bat costume to a masquerade party.Bruce Wayne has appeared as Batman in comic books, graphic novels, novels. cartoon series, television series, animated films, and feature films since his creation in 1939 by cartoonists Bob Kane and Bill Finger.","James \"Jim\" Worthington Gordon is a supporting character in DC Comics' Batman series. Created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane, he first appeared in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939). He was the first Batman supporting character to be introduced.In most incarnations of the Batman mythos, Gordon is the police commissioner of Batman's home of Gotham City. He shares the heros deep commitment of ridding the dark and corrupting city of crime. In Golden and Silver age comics and on the 1960s Batman television show, Gordon fully trusts, and is even somewhat dependent on Batman. In most modern stories, he is somewhat skeptical of Batman's vigilante method but recognizes the necessity of Batman and the two have a mutual respect and tacit friendship. He was the husband of Barbara Kean Gordon and Sarah Essen Gordon. Gordon is also the father or adopted father, depending on the continuity, of Barbara Gordon, the original Batgirl and later Oracle, and James Gordon, Jr..Gordon is an important part of the Batman mythos and has appeared in most other media adaptations of the character.Early characterizationsIn most versions of the Batman mythos, he is at one point or another depicted as Gotham City's police commissioner. He succeeded Commissioner Grogan in the rank at GCPD. Gordon frequently contacts Batman for help in solving various crimes, particularly those committed by supervillains. Because DC Comics retconned its characters' history in the 1985 miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths, and because of different interpretations in television and film, the details of Gordon's history vary from story to story.In the original pre-Crisis version of his history, Gordon was a police detective who initially bitterly resented the mysterious vigilante's interference in police business. Although the Batman seemed to fight on the side of justice, his methods and phenomenal track record for stopping crimes and capturing criminals embarrassed the police by comparison. Eventually, Batman met up with Gordon and persuaded the detective that they needed each other's help. Batman was deputized and worked with Gordon as an agent of the law.Post-CrisisBatman: Year OneThe post-Crisis version of the character was introduced in the mid-1980s storyline Batman: Year One, written by Frank Miller. In this version, Gordon was transferred back to the city after spending more than fifteen years in Chicago. A man of integrity, Gordon found that his only ally against the mob-controlled administration was the Batman. One of the most significant differences in this version is that Batman was never deputized and Gordon's relationship with him was kept out of the public eye whenever possible. It was also added that he was a Special Forces veteran who was more than capable of hand to hand combat.When Gordon needs to summon Batman, he uses the Bat-Signal, a specially modified Klieg searchlight with a stylized symbol of a bat placed on it so that it projects a large emblem shaped in Batman's bat insignia on the sky or buildings of Gotham City. Batman often disappears silently when Gordon's back is turned, often while Gordon is in the middle of a rant about legal red tape.The miniseries Gordon of Gotham takes place about nearly twenty years prior to the current events of the DC Universe and ten years before coming to Gotham in Batman: Year One. It reveals that Gordon, during his tenure in Chicago, struggled with his wife over conceiving a child while taking university night classes in criminology. He faces brutality among other officers after uncovering corruption within the force. Later, Gordon uncovers evidence of rigging the mayoral election and brings down two of his fellow officers, which leads to his commissioner recommending to him that he transfer to Gotham quickly.Batman: The Killing JokeIn the 1988 graphic novel The Killing Joke, the Joker kidnaps Gordon after shooting and paralyzing Barbara. He then cages Gordon in the freak show of an abandoned amusement park and forces him to look at enlarged photos of his wounded daughter naked in an effort to drive him insane, thus proving to Batman that even the most grounded, seemingly normal people can lose their minds after having \"a very bad day.\" Batman eventually apprehends the Joker and rescues Gordon. Despite the intense trauma he has endured, Gordon's sanity and code of ethics is intact; he insists that Batman apprehend the Joker without harming him in order to \"show him that our way works.\"No Man's LandThe No Man's Land storyline took place after Gotham was destroyed by an earthquake and isolated from outside assistance. Inside Gotham, Gordon struggled to maintain order amidst rampant crime. Batman was mysteriously absent for the initial three months, and Gordon felt somewhat betrayed. He forged an uneasy alliance with Two-Face but was later double-crossed, kidnapped, and put on trial by Two-Face for breaking their \"legally-binding\" alliance. He escaped punishment, and later met with Batman once again. In this confrontation, Gordon expressed his disgust towards Batman for letting Gotham \"fall into ruin\". Batman offered to prove his trust by revealing his secret identity, but Gordon refused to look when Batman removed his mask. Eventually their relationship was repaired.The death of Sarah EssenGordon fell in love with and married fellow officer Sarah Essen. However, Essen could not comprehend why Gordon needed Batman so much, which occasionally put a strain on their relationship. Unfortunately, she was fatally shot by the Joker at the end of the No Man's Land storyline. An enraged Gordon wanted to kill Joker, but instead was persuaded to shoot him in the leg, in revenge for Joker's shot which had paralyzed Gordon's daughter. Not long after this, Gordon was gunned down by a crook seeking revenge for a previous arrest. Though seriously injured, he eventually pulled througRetirementGordon retired from the police force after having served more than 20 years in it. He remained in Gotham, and occasionally enjoyed nighttime visits from Batman who came to him for company and advice. Commissioner Michael Akins has taken his position.After Barbara required surgery to save her life from the Brainiac virus, Gordon visited his adoptive daughter in Metropolis. She revealed to him her current role as Oracle, as well as her past as Batgirl. Gordon admitted that he knew of her life as Batgirl, but was pleasantly surprised to know of her career as the computer information broker of the heroes. He is very proud of her accomplishments.ReturnAs part of DC's \"One Year Later\" Gordon has returned to the role of Commissioner; as of the year-long jump he has been back in the job for 3 months. The circumstances behind this are currently unknown, though there have been allusions to extreme corruption within the GCPD. These allusions are supported by events within Gotham Central, especially involving Detective Jim Corrigan. Most recently, Gordon survived an attempt on his life by the Joker (Batman #655), who had drugged him with Joker Venom in an attack on the GCPD. He was taken to the hospital in time.Gordon and Batman's IdentityIn most versions of the mythos, Gordon is ignorant of Batman's identity, though some fans and writers feel that Gordon is smart enough to solve the puzzle but chooses not to in order to preserve Batman's effectiveness. In the 1966 Batman theatrical movie, Gordon explicitly states his desire not to know for such a reason. In Batman: Year One, Gordon claims not to see the unmasked Batman well (whom his wife at that time, Barbara, also sees) because he doesn't have his glasses on. The Batman: The Animated Series episode \"Over the Edge\" ends with a conversation between Commissioner Gordon and Barbara (his daughter not his wife) which implies that Gordon at least knows that Barbara is Batgirl but cannot acknowledge it because that would put him in an uncomfortable legal position. During No Man's Land, Batman attempts to regain Gordon's trust by revealing himself, but Gordon turns his face away, stating that he does not want to know his identity.Likewise, in the 1980s Detective Comics storyline Blind Justice, the world at large incorrectly supposes Batman is dead and Gordon comments to Bruce Wayne that Batman has earned the right to retirement if he so desires. He then rather pointedly asks Bruce's advice on whether or not he should reveal that Batman still lives. In Batman: Year One, Gordon suspects early on that Bruce Wayne may be Batman, though he never follows up on his suspicions. In Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns, Gordon and Bruce Wayne are portrayed as close friends, with Bruce having revealed his identity to Gordon years ago.FamilyPre-CrisisIn Pre-Crisis continuity, James Gordon was the biological father of Anthony \"Tony\" Gordon and Barbara Gordon (later Batgirl). Originally referred to as a college student, Tony later disappeared while hiding from Communist spies. He was later reunited with his sister Barbara and perished in a battle with the Sino-Supermen. (Batman Family #12, Detective Comics # 482)Post-CrisisIn Post-Crisis continuity, there has been no mention of Tony Gordon. James Gordon has a brother, Roger Gordon. James and his wife, Barbara Eileen Gordon, are the parents of a son, James Gordon, Jr. (Batman #404-407)Roger Gordon and his wife, Thelma Gordon, are parents of Barbara \"Babs\" Gordon (later Batgirl and Oracle). When Babs was 12 or 13, her parents (Roger and Thelma) died. She moved to Gotham City and lived with her uncle, aunt and cousin. Eventually, James and Barbara adopted Babs. However, the couple divorced and James retained custody of Babs, while Barbara moved to Chicago with James, Jr. (Secret Origins #20). Barbara and James, Jr. are rarely mentioned and presumably still reside in Chicago. It has recently been revealed that James had an affair with Thelma, and might be the biological father of Babs. (Batman: Gotham Knights #6)In one post-crisis story, James and Babs visit the grave of his late wife. However, this story is later retconned when it is revealed that his wife is not dead, but instead they are divorced. James eventually marries Sarah Essen. (Batman Annual #13, Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight Annual #2). Unfortunately, Sarah was murdered by the Joker at the end of the No Man's Land storyline. During the One Year Later storyline, Gordon makes a slight reference to his ex-wife Barbara \"doing well,\" implying that he keeps tabs on her.FILMIn the 2005 film Batman Begins Gordon is popularly portrayed by Gary Oldman. The film partly concerns Gordon's rise from beat cop to Sergeant and, by the end of the film, Lieutenant. He did his best to comfort the eight-year-old Bruce Wayne after the murder of his parents when he was a young man, and Wayne later recognizes him as one of the few honest police officers in the city, and would always remember his kindness as it gave Bruce the strength he needs after his parents' death. Seventeen to eighteen years later, after promoted as a detective-sergeant on the force, while working late on his office, Bruce, wearing a ski-mask, visited Gordon's office, to ask Gordon about Carmine Falcone's criminal operation and the police inability to stop the notorious crimelord. When Bruce threatens Gordon with a common office stapler, which was thought to be a pistol, Bruce suggested that they form an alliance. This is kept secret from all other police officers, with Gordon proving pivotal in Batman's defeat of Ra's al Ghul by driving the Batmobile to destroy the Gotham monorail tracks and prevent the madman from vaporising the water supply. James Gordon's involvement in saving Gotham results in his promotion to the rank of lieutenant. He developed a Bat-Signal with the department's spare searchlight to summon Batman in times of need. Gordon called the Batman to announce his promotion on the force, his appreciation to the Dark Knight, and also to discuss a criminal whose identity is a mystery. The criminal has committed an armed robbery and double homicide, with an apparent taste for theatrics, leaving a calling card: a Joker playing card.Although he does not condone vigilantes, Gordon sees that it is necessary to operate outside of laws in the crime-filled Gotham City, especially since most members of Gotham's police department are mired in corruption. Before the emergence of Batman, he was increasingly jaded and disillusioned of the corruptions around him. The arrival of the Dark Knight gives the police detective the hope he needs to build a better Gotham for his wife and children. After being promoted as a lieutenant, he is determined to clean the department up from within. The detective is still clueless of who Batman is, or that he is one of the people who inspired the Dark Knight to be what he is now.James Gordon is a police lieutenant in the Gotham City Police Department. He has become a friend and ally to the Batman.From Wikipedia ( http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/James_Gordon_%28comics%29 ):","The origin of Bane has similarities with another fictional character, Alexandre Dumas' Edmond Dantes. Born to serve the life sentence of his father, Bane's childhood and early adult life are spent behind the walls of Pe\u00f1a Duro, an infamous prison located in Santa Prisca. Though imprisoned, his natural abilities allow him to develop extraordinary skills within the prison's walls. He reads as many books as he can get his hands on, builds up his body in the prison's gymnasium, and learns to fight in the merciless school of prison life. Despite his circumstances, he appears to have found teachers of various sorts during his incarceration, ranging from hardened convicts to an elderly Jesuit priest, under whose tutelage he apparently receives a classical education. Bane murders this priest upon his return to Santa Prisca years later. However, he commits his first murder at the age of eight, stabbing a criminal who wanted to use him to gain information about the prison.\nDuring his years in prison, Bane carries a teddy bear heolani where the titular bumbling and goofy superhero has constant and heated discussions with a stuffed teddy called Piccettino, whose voice only he can hear).Bane ultimately establishes himself as the \"king\" of Pe\u00f1a Duro prison. The prison's controllers take note and, eventually, force him to become a test subject for a mysterious drug known as Venom, which had killed all other subjects. It nearly kills him at first, but he survives and finds its effects useful towards enhancing his physical strength, although he needs to take it every 12 hours (via a system of cables pumped directly into his brain) or he would suffer debilitating side-effects.","SPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTA hard-nosed young Gotham beat cop who is secretly helping Batman to bring down the super-villain known as Bane.

In times of extreme combat the\nmetal skeleton can be seen where patches of skin have been destroyed.The T-800 has been sent back from a future where machines became\nartificially intelligent. A program of A.I was developed by Cyberdine\nsystems, and was incorporated into a United States military program\nknown as Skynet. However, Skynet had been gaining more and more control\nand ultimately had access to every computer on the planet. When the US\nfully activated Skynet, at that point it had complete control, and\nacted systematically to eliminate the only threat to it: humans. For protection, it launched nuclear weapons humans had built and killed approximately 3 billion people in the initial attack.\nThe attack started a new war between man and machine and subsequently the T-800 was\ndeveloped years later. By appearing human it proved advantageous on\nthe battlefield for infiltration and assassination. However the humans\nhad united under a leader John Connor, and proved they were not going\nto give up at all. The machines in an effort to stop this problem sent\nback a T-800 back in time to kill John Connor's mother, Sarah. The\nhumans also sent back a soldier to protect Sarah, Kyle Reese. Reese\nfell in love with Sarah while on his mission, and consequently became\nJohn's father. Reese died trying to destroy the T-800 using homemade dynamite however, but Sarah survived the T-800, crushing it using factory equipment.The machines sent back a new model, a T-1000 when John was ten, and the humans again sent back a T-800 series Model 101 that Connor captured and re-programmed to\nprotect John. John and T-800 fled the T-1000, and saved his mother who\nhad been sent to a mental facility. While on the run Connor essentially\nprogrammed the T-800 to act human, teaching him human expressions, and\ntrying to impose human thought on it. The T-800 despite being a less\nsuperior model completed its mission destroying the T-1000, and\nconsequently self terminated to eliminate any trace of the future. This\nwas heartbreaking for John who had grown very emotionally attached to\nthe model.When John was a young adult in our time line, he fell off the grid. The\nmachines in the future sent back a newer far superior model to kill\nsome of his lieutenants in the resistance because John could not be\nlocated. They sent a T-X, programmed for cybernetic combat. \"An\nanti-terminator terminator\" The humans sent back a T-800 based on\nJohn's previous experience. The T-800 at that point was an obsolete\nmodel, and nearly failed his mission when the T-X tried to program it\nto kill John. The T-800 nearly killed John, but was experiencing\nconflicting mission objectives. John appealed to it however, telling it\nthat it was about to fail its mission. As such the T-800 powered down\nand restarted. In a final stand it held off the T-X long enough for\nJohn to escape to safety in a fallout shelter. The T-800 told John \"We\nwill meet again\" before he terminated the T-X. The final attack on John\nhappened immediately before Judgment Day, the nickname for the day\nwhen the bombs fell.","In \"The Terminator\" and \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" timeline, Sarah Connor was a 19-year-old waitress living in L.A when, on a typical night, she was saved by a young soldier, Kyle Reese. Kyle told her that he was sent by her unborn son from the future to save her from The Terminator. Kyle dies while accomplishing his mission, and Sarah is left pregnant with his child and baring the burden of knowing that the nuclear war against the machines is coming. Ten years after Kyle's death, Sarah has become a warrior, strong and determined, unyeilding. But in her determination, she bombed a computer factory and was arrested, deemed criminally insane, and thrown into a mental hospital. Her teenage son, John, accompanied by a reprogramed Terminator from the future, break her out of the high security hospital and continue on their mission to prevent the impending war.\nBy destroying the remains of the first terminator and part of the Cyberdine building, Sarah, her son and the Terminator delay the war with the machines.On \"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\" timeline, she succumbed to terminal leukemia and lived long enough to see the original 1997 \"Judgment Day\" pass without incident, and was cremated in Mexico. Her ashes were spread at sea while a casket containing a cache of weapons was placed for John to find at a false grave site in accordance with her will, never truly believing that they had beaten Skynet, even at the end.On \"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles\" timeline - which picks up after \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" and splits the timeline away from \"Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines\" - she and her son continue with their lives on the run, changing schools and towns all the time until they are approached by two cyborgs, Cameron and Cromartie, in Red Valley, New Mexico. Cameron is assigned to protect Sarah and John so she helps them by traveling to 2007 via time machine. There Sarah, Cameron, John, and Derek Reese (Kyle Reese's older brother) try and find ways to stop Skynet from ever being built. From Cameron, she learned of the her future death from cancer as she find herself not only trying to continue her missions to prevent Skynet's birth and preparing John's future role, but also preventing her own death as well.","In \"The Terminator\" and \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" timeline, John Connor is the leader of the human rebel group Tech-Com that opposes them. Skynet, the supercomputer mainframe of the machines, decides that John Connor is the focal point of the rebellion and his termination would end the opposition. After repeated failures at terminating John during the war, Skynet decides to use a time dilation device to send android assassins called Terminators to various points in John Connor's past in an attempt to terminate him before the war begins.\nJohn was born when his mother Sarah Connor was hiding off the grid after the events of The Terminator. Sarah had decided to leave comfortable living to keep John safe and to prepare him for his future role as the leader of the human rebellion during the machine war. John spent the early years of his life learning about weapons, computer technology and espionage.When his mother was captured for trying to blow up a Cyberdyne research facility in the early 1990s, John was seized by social workers who told him that his mother's stories of the postapocalyptic future were delusions. Accordingly, Sarah was sent to a mental institution and John to foster parents Todd and Janelle Voight. John was unable to cope with suburban living and became a juvenile delinquent. In 1995 when he was only ten he was confronted with the T-1000 that was sent to terminate him, and upon realizing that his mother's stories were true, he and his protector, a reprogrammed T-800, helped Sarah escape from the mental institution.During their time together John bonded with the T-800 (referred to as \"Uncle Bob\" in the books: T2: Infiltrator, T2: Rising Storm, and T2: The Future War.), who became a friend and father figure to him. However, once the T-1000 was destroyed along with all of Cyberdyne's research, the T-800 asked that it be destroyed also so that its technology would not be discovered and used by others.In \"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\" timeline, John continued to live off the grid after the events of \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day,\" even as the original Judgment Day deadline of August 29th, 1997 came to pass without incident. His mother eventually developed leukemia and died. John refused to attend her funeral, instead fleeing the day after she died.In 2004, John crossed paths with Katherine \"Kate\" Brewster, a former neighbor from when he was living with his foster parents. It is also at this time that he is attacked by the T-X and saved by another reprogrammed T-850, revealing that Judgment Day had not been avoided as he had initially thought, but merely delayed by seven years. Although John and Kate try to halt the launching of Skynet, they are led to an underground bunker where they are kept safe as the first nuclear assault is launched on the United States as a result of Skynet's manipulations. It is via the working radios in this bunker that John starts his career as a military leader.During the war in 2018 and the events of \"Terminator Salvation\", Connor is not yet the leader of the resistance, and must cope with the arrival of the mysterious Marcus Wright and the changes to the future he was not prepared for. He also must rescue his future father Kyle Reese before Skynet kills him. John's is also expecting his first child with Kate, who he married after the event of the third film.In \"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (alternate timeline):\" two years after Cyberdyne Systems' destruction, Sarah and John went into hiding from the authorities using the aliases of Sarah and John Reese. Sarah even engaged to paramedic Charley Dixon, whom John sees as a father figure and help him picked the engangement ring for his mother. However, fearing to be discovered, Sarah left Charley with John.Settled in Red Valley, New Mexico, John meets a beautiful girl named Cameron Phillips, only later to be discovered to be a Terminator reprogrammed to protect him and his mother from a T-888. Learning that the Judgment Day was postponed to April 21, 2011, Cameron led John and his mother to a bank, the Security Trust of Los Angeles, where The Resistance hid components of an isotope-fueled weapon and a time displacement device. Using the time machine, John, Sarah and Cameron travelled forward to 2007 where they can completely off the grid from Skynet and the country's law enforcement agencies so they can concentrate on preventing Skynet's birth.\nBut the world in 2007 proves complex: they find Skynet has sent additional Terminators back in time to support its own creation, and the resistance movement has sent back its own fighters to interfere. As they seek out an intuitive chess computer called The Turk, which may be a precursor to Skynet, they forge an alliance with Derek Reese, one of the Resistance's First Lieutenant and his father's older brother. After learning his uncle's existence, John desires to learn of his father from Derek, but his mother harbors distrust on the man as she is aware of his murderous nature and refuse to let Derek knows of John's parentage. However, Derek already figured it out after seeing John has a resemblance to his deceased brother. During John's birthday, Derek took his nephew to a park where he played baseball with Kyle during their childhoods, therefore meeting Derek and Kyle's younger selves. John was overwhelmed of finally meeting his father. Afterward, John and Derek begins their relationship, but keeping Sarah in the dark of Derek's knowledge.John currently enrolls in Campo de Cahuenga High School under the name of John Baum, where he is friends with his fellow students Morris and Riley. Also, in contrast to the father-son bond between himself and the T-101, it is shown in multiple episodes that he has romantic feelings towards Cameron, which, at times, seem to be at least partially mutual. He also developing an attraction to Riley, who represents a chance of normalcy in his life.Attempted assassinationsMay 12, 1984\nBefore John Connor is born, a T-800 is sent back in time to 1:52 AM on May 12, 1984 to kill his mother, Sarah Connor. In response, the future John Connor sends a soldier, Kyle Reese to 2:01 AM on the same day, so that he can protect his mother before he can be conceived. When Reese meets Sarah Connor, they have a brief affair during which they conceive John.June 8, 1995\nThe second Terminator to be sent back in time is the more advanced T-1000, which Skynet sends to 4:58 AM on June 8, 1995 to terminate John Connor who is by then a young child, ten years old according to the police computer. In the future, elder John Connor retaliates by sending a re-programmed T-800 back to 3:14 AM on June 8, 1995 to protect his younger self.September 7th 1999 (T:TSCC timetime)\nA T-888, which identify itself as Cromartie, sent back to 1999 to assisinate John Connor. On Red Valley, New Mexico, as it about to succeed, only ecounter interference from a T-OK715, under the alias of Cameron Phiilps, reprogramed by The Resistance to aid John Connor and his mother Sarah. After they defeated it by using an isotop-fueled weapon hidden in a bank, The Security Trust of Los Angeles, T-OK715 and the Connors travelled forward to 2007 to halt Skynet's completion. T-888 followed them and resuming its mission.July 24, 2004 (Judgment Day)\nMain article: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\nThe final Terminator seen to be sent back in time is the T-X, which was sent to 1:14 AM on July 24th, 2004. Unlike its two predecessors, the T-X's objective was to terminate Connor's future officers as secondary targets. It is sent to terminate not only John Connor, but also Kate Brewster as its primary targets. The T-X and Brewster cross paths briefly, however, Kate is rescued by the T-850 terminator moments later.A protector T-850 is also sent back in time from the future to protect John, but unlike the previous protectors, it was not sent by elder John. The reprogrammed T-850 was actually sent by his future wife and second-in-command, Katherine Brewster (daughter of Skynet's creator General Robert Brewster), due to the fact that Connor himself had actually been killed by that very Terminator.2018\nSkynet manipulated Marcus Wright, a death row inmate turned cyborg, of leading John Connor and Kyle Reese to Skynet Central where a T-800 Model 101 was waiting to eliminate them both. Marcus rebelled against Skynet, seeks retribution toward Skynet for his transformation, and aiding Connor and Reese of defeating the T-800.July 4, 2032\nAccording to the T-850 that was later reprogrammed as his second protector and sent into the past, \"he\" assassinated John Connor on July 4, 2032. This terminator further and explained that Skynet selected a Model 101 because of the emotional attachment Connor would feel upon seeing its familiar physiognomy due to the events that transpired in the second movie.Alternate future\nIn an omitted original ending of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, an adult John is shown as a U.S. Senator in a future of peace, and has a daughter of his own. This alternate future is presumably the result of the successful destruction of the Cyberdyne research lab by Sarah Connor, young John Connor, the re-programmed T-800 and Miles Dyson earlier in the movie. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines negates the presence of this alternate future with its claim that Judgment Day could not be avoided, only postponedAGE ISSUES Within 3 movies:Terminator 3 alters John Connor's age from that shown in the earlier films. Taking place in 2004, it states that John Connor's age is 22. This places Connor's birth in 1982, rather than the previously established 1985, which was confirmed visually in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. This version of John Connor mentions seeing the Terminator previously when he was 13. In addition to this, in The Sarah Connor Chronicles John Connor is aged 15 in late 1999. This places his date of birth in 1984.","null","Peter Silberman is a psychologist, and the only character to appear in the first three Terminator films (the Terminator is a different model of the same type in each film). He is played in all his appearances by Earl Boen.In the first Terminator, he is a Los Angeles criminal psychologist. He questions Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor when they are brought into the police station, and believes Reese to be insane. He leaves moments before the Terminator attacks the police station.In Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Silberman is a member of the staff at Pescadero State Hospital, and is still a psychologist, now specializing in mentally unsound patients rather than criminal psychology. He analyzes Sarah, trying to make progress with her (and he does have her best interests at heart), but he has little success and she has attacked him several times (and used him as a hostage once when he did not let her be transferred to minimum security). He witnesses both the T-800 and the T-1000 doing things impossible for normal humans to do, proving Sarah's story (which he mocked several times).In Terminator 3 he makes a short appearance as a post-trauma counselor with an LAPD SWAT team. He now attributes the Terminators he saw in Judgment Day to be hallucinations caused by trauma, though he has some self-doubt. When he sees the T-850 again, he flees the scene. He was originally scripted to be killed in a nuclear explosion, but was not.","Miles Bennett Dyson, a high ranking employee at Cyberdyne Systems, will invent a new microprocessor that will revolutionize the entire military computer system.Dyson is asked permission to conduct a test with a device that is only referred to as 'it'. When one of his co-workers asks where it came from, he gives him the same answer he received from his superiors: Don't ask. Dyson goes into the vault, where he observes a fragment of a computer chip, and a metal robot arm that was clearly once attached to a Terminator.Sarah later arrives at the Dyson residence and sets up her silenced gun behind the swimming pool, where she can see Miles working on his computer, unaware of the danger outside. Dyson's son Danny is playing in the house with his remote controlled car, waving off his mothers orders to go to bed like his sister. Outside, Sarah loads the rifle and takes aim, pointing a red laser at the back of Miles head. At the moment of firing, Danny drives the remote car against Miles' foot, making him bend over to pick it up. The bullet misses him and hits the computer screen. With Miles realising the shot came through the window, Sarah fires again but misses. Miles takes cover behind his desk, so Sarah takes the house under rapid fire. Miles warns away his wife and son as Sarah reloads and empties another clip into the room. Miles sees her and makes a run for his living room. Sarah fires several shots at him, and the third one hits Miles in the shoulder. He collapses to the floor as his wife and son get to him. Sarah tries to force them away at gunpoint, but the young boy stays, pleading for his fathers life. Miles pushes the boy away to his mother, asking Sarah to let the boy go, but her eyes are wild with rage. She raves at the bewildered man that everything is his fault and that she will not let him do it. Miles starts to cry uncontrollably, which weakens Sarah's resolve, making her realise what she is about to do, and prevents her from pulling the trigger. She backs away and sinks to the floor, crying. In the meanwhile, John and Terminator enter the ravaged house. The Terminator diagnoses that Miles' injury is only a flesh wound, and that his wife can stop the bleeding by pressing the wound. Miles asks John and Terminator who they are. John gives Terminator a knife, tells it to show to Miles what it is, and takes Danny away to his room. With gasps and cries of horror and disbelief, Miles and his wife watch the Terminator make large cuts in its arm, and remove the skin to reveal the same kind of arm Miles has at Cyberdyne. Terminator requests that Miles and Tarissa listen carefully.Dyson listens while the Terminator speaks of the future. Miles is taken aback by the story, but tries to defend himself against accusations for things he has not even done yet by asking how he was supposed to know. Sarah sneers that this is the excuse of all men, thinking they are great and creative, but invent nothing but death and destruction. John cuts off her reproaches, because those sort of discussions dont get them anywhere. Miles tells them he will stop working on the processor and quit his job at Cyberdyne, but Sarah and Terminator convince him that nobody must be allowed to complete his work; the lab and all relevant files in his home must be destroyed also. Miles ask if they know about the chip at Cyberdyne, which came from the first Terminator, although he was not informed about its origin at the time; this confirms all of Sarahs suspicions about the factory covering up the whole incident with her and the first Terminator. The chip was broken, but it gave Miles the inspiration for his revolutionary new chip design. Miles offers to help them pass Cyberdynes' security to destroy it as well.The group arrives at the Cyberdyne building, packed with large bags full of equipment. Miles gets them through the main entrance to the security desk, and tries to convince the guard that they are friends who he wants to show around. As the guard berates him about visitors needing special authorization, they draw their weapons and Terminator tells him that it insists. They restrain the guard and use an elevator to move to the second floor, where Miles explains how they need his key and another one in the security station to open the vault where the chip and Terminator arm are. Miles and Sarah enter the security station, as the guard triggers the silent alarm. Because of this, Miles' access card cannot open the key locker anymore; the alarm has neutralized all codes inside the building. He wants to abort, but Sarah convinces him they have to go all the way. John assures them that his special machine for illegally withdrawing money from ATMs will do the trick. Miles' entry code also no longer opens the door to the lab, so Terminator suggests to use his, which means blowing through the door with a grenade launcher. This sets off the gaseous fire extinguishing system, preventing Sarah and Miles from entering the lab. However, Terminator can walk through the gasses unharmed, and retrieves two breathing masks for them. They enter the lab and get to work.John has finally opened the key locker and retrieves the vault key. The Terminator gives Miles a remote control, showing him how they are going to set off the explosions. John enters the lab with the key, telling the rest they got company from about the entire police force. John and Miles reach the vault and open it. John simply breaks the glass cases around the chip fragment and metal arm. As Sarah asks Miles for the detonator, the SWAT team bursts inside the lab, opening fire. Sarah takes cover behind a desk, but Miles is hit several times, and sinks to the floor. Sarah looks at the mortally injured Miles, who holds the detonator in his hand. With a silent expression, he assures her that he will take care of it. The SWAT team advances through the lab towards Miles, who is holding a piece of his chip model above a detonator switch. With heavy dying breaths, he tells the SWAT leader that he doesn't know how much longer he can hold it. Realising the imminent danger, the SWAT leader orders his team to pull back immediately. Miles' rate of breathing becomes slower and slower and finally stops, and he drops the piece onto the trigger. An enormous explosion erupts from the building, destroying the entire lab and killing Dyson.","Tarissa Dyson is the wife of Miles Dyson. She stayed by Miles' side when he was attacked by Sarah at gunpoint. She also had to face the sad reality of the world if the future was not changed when she was shown the Terminator's arm below it's flesh. She wonders if we are always changing the future.","Sarah, John and Terminator arrive at a outlying farm in the desert, that seems abandoned. However, her friend Enrique, being very suspicious of unannounced visitors, comes out of hiding at the sound of her voice. He welcomes Sarah, John and Terminator (who John introduces as Uncle Bob) and tells them that they are all over the news as wanted persons. Enrique is not too thrilled to hear that Sarah has come to collect most of his stuff: clothes, food and a truck; she orders John and Terminator to gather weapons. Terminator opens a secret stash filled with lots of weapons and ammunition. Sarah notifies Enrique about her plans to cross the border after nightfall, and tells him to leave the range as well, since it is dangerous for him too. He already expected that Sarah would bring trouble, but he seems to be used to it. Sarah carves her knife into a wooden table, and watches Enrique playing happily with his family. John hears from Enrique that he and Terminator are supposed to proceed towards the south, where Sarah will team up with them tomorrow.","At John's house, Tim and him are adjusting the motorcycle and listening to Guns & Roses. John's foster parents Todd and Janelle Voight make several fruitless attempts to get John to clean up his room, but he just ignores and ridicules them and leaves on his bike with Tim. John is stealing money from an ATM. Tim finds a picture of Sarah in John's bag (it is the picture taken of Sarah from The Terminator, and was later given to Johns father, Kyle Reese), to which John comments that Sarah is a complete psycho, because she got arrested for trying to blow up a computer factory. They take off, missing the searching Terminator by a few blocks. John then drives with Tim through an abandoned canal, while the Terminator passes overhead, identifies him and lays in a pursuit. At the mall in a game hall, the T-1000 bumps into Tim who is getting some more quarters. He shows Tim John's picture, Tim pretends he doesn't know the person, but quickly walks back to John and warns him that a cop is looking for him. Tim attempts to misdirect the T-1000, who has already spotted John, by saying he went somewhere else, but gets knocked out of the way.","At their house, Janelle orders Todd to make a fruitless attempt to get John to clean up his room. Next time we see her she is sadly terminated, after being copied by the T-1000.","At John Connor's house, his foster parents Todd and Janelle Voight make a fruitless attempts to get John to clean up his room. Janelle is fed up and sends a relunctant Todd out to talk to John, but he just ignores and ridicules him, telling Todd that Janelle is not his mom. He leaves on his bike with his friend Tim.The Terminator and John stop by a pay phone because John insist on calling his foster parents to warn them. Janelle answers, and expresses her concern for John. John is confused, as she is never this nice. He can hear Todd through the phone yelling at the dog for barking continuously, but he is suddenly silenced. John worries that the T-1000 might be there already. Terminator asks John for the dog's name; its Max. He takes over the horn and asks Janelle in Johns voice what is wrong with Wolfy. Janelle says Wolfy is fine. Terminator hangs up and says John's foster parents are dead. The camera pulls back on Janelle and shows that her arm has been gradually formed into a silver blade, which has skewered Todd's head.","\"Twin Sarah\" is the Sarah in the plaid dress in military Sarah's \"NO FATE\" dream.

She had a daughter, Amanda Ripley MacLaren, and no other descendants (not counting her clone in Alien Resurrection).In 2122, Ripley was employed as Warrant Officer (Ident Number W5645022460H) for the Weyland-Yutani corporation, working on the USCSS Nostromo, which was towing massive quantities of raw ore to Earth from Thedus.Along with the rest of the crew, she was awakened 10 months prematurely from hypersleep by Mother, the ship's computer, to answer a curious transmission received from moon LV-426.[1] Upon landing, Executive Officer Kane, Captain Dallas, and Navigator Lambert disembarked and investigated the source of the transmission a derelict alien space craft. While investigating the derelict craft, an alien parasite attached itself to Executive Officer Kane.Ripley initially refused to allow the landing party back onto the ship after they were injured, citing quarantine regulations. Her order was ignored by Science Officer Ash, whom she began to distrust more and more as time went on. The bypassing of quarantine had serious consequences when an extraterrestrial larva or embryo of some kind deposited by the \"facehugger\" that attacked Kane matured and erupted from his chest. Kane was killed by this alien birth, and the creature quickly took to preying upon the rest of the crew.Following the presumed death of Dallas, Ripley became the Nostromo's commanding officer, and learned from Mother the final piece of the puzzle: Special Order 937, a secret Company policy to study the very creature that was stalking them at the expense of their lives. With the crew around her dwindling just as quickly as the creature seemed to be growing, Ripley began the vessel's self-destruct sequence. The Nostromo, the cooling rods removed from its reactor, melted down and exploded violently, moments after Ripley (in the escape ship Narcissus) reached safety. She was expecting to be rescued within a few weeks, but she and her cat Jones would drift \"right through the core systems\" and spend the next 57 years in hypersleep. Ripley's only daughter, Amanda, died at the age of 66, just two years before Ripley would be found and awoken from hypersleep. A photograph shown in a brief clip in the special edition of Aliens (1986) has her date of death listed as \"12.23.20\", but a later line from Carter Burke places the events of the same film 57 years later (2179).After her subsequent rescue by a salvage crew, Ripley was made a Lieutenant and reluctantly returned to LV-426 with a team of United States Colonial Marines to rescue the colonists of Hadley's Hope, and basically became the unit's de facto leader after most of the marines were killed. Ripley escaped with one colonist, an injured marine, half of an android, and (unbeknownst to her) a super-facehugger (Emperess class : Multi-embryo producing organism, awakened only when the death of the current Alien Queen is unavoidable). She subsequently found herself marooned on Fiorina \"Fury\" 161, an outer-veil mineral ore refinery and correctional facility, where she died while trying to prevent Weyland-Yutani from getting its hands on the alien queen that was inside of her.Various clones of Ellen Ripley were later created by the military for the purpose of experimentation with the alien. (See Alien: Resurrection (1997)) The protagonist clone, Ellen Ripley 8 has traces of xenomorph genes inside of her that gave her superior strength, endurance, caustic blood and the ability to sense and communicate with the creatures. Due to some form of \"genetic memory\" derived from the aliens the Ripley clone could learn at an extremely rapid rate and recall some of the original's memories and personality. The clone was not an exact mental duplicate as she was more violent, fatalistic and sadistic than the original. She also had a mild empathy for the xenomorphs and antipathy for humans.Ripley 8 discovered the seven experimental, deformed clone Ripleys in a military lab. At the pleading of the last surviving one (Ripley 7) she incinerated the lab and all the clones with a flamethrower.","Lambert is the Chief Navigator on the Nostromo. She is prone to emotional outbursts and lacks enthusiasm in regards to finding alien lifeforms, she is cautious, and is clearly aware of the dangers of foreign places, and alien environments. Lambert is ruled by her emotions, and is somewhat cynical in her thoughts. She has a keen instinct for her own self preservation, but will freeze when conftronted by danger. She is not good in crisis situations.","Brett is an engineer on the spaceship Nostromo. He has a casual attitude to work, and his often grumpy nature may well be an act. Motivated by money, and not interested in investigating alien lifeforms, Brett can be flippant in attitude and prone to careless actions. He has a good reason not to like cats....","'Curiousity killed the cat' as the old saying goes. (although Jones the cat survives) Kane, is an enthusiastic adventurer. The Executive Officer, and second in command after Dallas. He is British, and appears thoughtful and intelligent. However, he is somewhat foolhardy, reserved, yet reckless. His eagerness to discover the existence of an alien lifeform proves to be his undoing. Kane is like a moth drawn to the flame, and his determined actions result in the destruction of the Nostromo.","Ash is the Nostromo's Science Officer. He was appointed to the position at short notice, and is therefore a mystery to Captain Dallas. He is disliked by Ripley due to the fact that he undermines her authority. Ash is programmed with one simple desire, the discovery and preservation of an alien life form. His personality is defined by his cold analytical outlook on human existence, and he appears to be unconcerned for the welfare of other crew members. Ash allows them to suffer so he can achieve his ambitions. He is calm, and lacking in empathy for the human species.When the ship recieved the distress call, Ash monitored the expedition to the derelict spaceship. When the crew returned with an infected Kane, Ripley was reluctant to allow them entry, but Ash allowed them to re-enter and examined the facehugger that had attached itself to Kane. He attempted to cut it off, but the first incision revealed that the facehugger revealed some of it's highly corrosive blood, which burned through several decks of the ship.After Kane woke, apparently unharmed, Ash examined the facehugger. Shortly after during a meal, Kane began choking, Ash initially watched while the other members of the crew tried to help him, but eventually helped to restrain Kane just before the chestburster emerged.After Brett and Dallas were killed by the alien, Ripley discovered that the alien was brought aboard intentionally. When she confronted Ash, he tried to kill her, but was stoppped when Parker clubbed him over the neck with a fire extinguisher, decapitating him and revealing him to be an android, who had been programmed to bring back the alien at the expense of the rest of the crew.the remaining crew members Ripley, Parker, and Lamburt were able to reconnect some of Ash's circuits, allowing them to speak to him. He explained his true intentions, and also expressed his sympathies towards them.","Parker is the Chief Engineer. He is a big, strong, no nonsense kind of man, and likes his own space, he is territorial in nature. He has a good sense of humour, but if you push him too much he is liable to explode with rage. However, it could be argued that much of his bravado may mask a far softer nature. He is good friends with Brett, but is not so keen on Ripley, who he tries to bully verbally. He does care about his colleagues, and in the heat of the moment he is capable of reckless, almost suicidal courage. Like Brett he is interested in making more money, and believes he should be given an equal share. He feels under valued for his work. Parker is ferociously determined to destroy the Alien, even if he has to use his own physical strength to do so.","The Alien itself is the ultimate predator. It has a full life cycle, starting with the Facehugger which attaches itself to the face of its victim and implants an Embryo within it. The Embryo then grows into the Garrett Nicklesen stage where as its name implies, violently bursts from the chest of its victim upon full growth. In a few hours time the Garrett Nicklesen molts and becomes a Drone\/Warrior. The Drone is the Alien we are all familiar with. It is around eight feet tall when fully erect. It has jet black skin that is either smooth or has an insect-like shimmer. The Drone is most famous for its infamous mouth which is a deadly set of double mandibles, one on the outside and another within that. This inner mouth which can also be seen as a tongue of sorts, can bite through metal and crush bone. The Drone also has sharp claws and a barbed tail. The barb on the end of the tail is said to have paralytic properties but that is not seen in any of the films so it assumed to be non-canon.The Drone also has a Quadrupedal form known as a Runner. This form occurs when the Facehugger implants a quadrupedal host like the Dog in Alien 3 (or an Ox if you watch the Assembly Cut). This form was also jokingly called the \"Bambi-Burster\" or \"Bambi-Runner\".The most powerful Alien seen in the film franchise is the Queen. The Alien Queen is huge and much more animal-like compared to the Drones. The Queen has an immense ovipositor attached to her back end which allows her to lay eggs. This ovipositor was also converted into a womb in Alien Resurrection when the Queen gave birth to the Human\/Alien hybrid called the Newborn. The Queen is easily differentiated from her Drones by the large upswept crest on her head. This crest protects her head which is much larger than that of the Drone. She also has claws and a barbed tail. She stands at about forty feet tall when detached from her ovipositor.The Newborn is probably the most frightening of the Aliens. This grotesque beast came about through corrupted gene splicing from the cloning of Ripley 8 in Alien Resurrection. The Alien Queen gave live birth to the creature after she stopped her first cycle of egg-laying. According to Doctor Rediman, the womb was \"Ripley's gift to her!\". Unlike its kin, the Newborn had soft-almost human-like skin and much longer arms and legs. It was bipedal in nature and had visible fangs as well as a set of eyes set deep in the human-like eye sockets. In fact the entire structure of the Newborn's skull is visibly human in front while being more like a Xenomorph in the back. The Newborn also had a tongue and seemed to have rudimentary emotions like anger and pain.","Mother is responsible for the welfare of the crew. She is a highly advanced computer system who monitors the crew during their time in Cryogenic Sleep. She is at her simplest a mechanical construct, and as such lacks any real sense of her own identity."],"ImageURL":["http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTU0Mzk4NjY0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzEwOTk2._V1._SX485_SY728_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTA5Njc3MzU2ODdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDEwNDgxMjM@._V1._SX640_SY957_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTU2ODk5MjE0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTAwODAxNA@@._V1._SX640_SY945_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjIyMjU2MzIxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI2NTUyMw@@._V1._SX640_SY447_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTQ3MDg5ODY2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDAwOTk2._V1._SX485_SY728_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTQ2ODA5MjY3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjAwOTk2._V1._SX485_SY323_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTMwNjUxOTExN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODE2NTUyMw@@._V1._SX640_SY439_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNDUzMTUwNjA4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzEwOTk2._V1._SX485_SY323_.jpg","null"],"Name":["Dallas","Ripley","Lambert","Brett","Kane","Ash","Parker","Alien","Mother\n\n                (voice)"]},"39":{"Actor":[],"Bio":[],"ImageURL":[],"Name":[]}},"Link":"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0078748\/","Title":"Alien"},{"Characters":{"0":{"Actor":["Cary Grant","Eva Marie Saint","James Mason","Jessie Royce Landis","Leo G.

The plot centers on him striving to clear his name in a case of driving under the influence, and later of a case of murder, all while being pursued by the police, who want to bring him to justice, and gang of villains, who want to kill him. Thornhill is a suave New York man-about-town until he finds himself in his predicament, but one with a prickly love-hate relationship with his sharp-tongued, wise-cracking mother (Jesse Royce Landis). His primary antagonist is the leader of the gang of international secrets dealers, Phillip Vandamm (James Mason), though Vandamm's reptilian right-hand man, Leonard (Martin Landau), is at least as sinister. His sometime ally, and romantic interest, is the beautiful Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), who may or may not be trustworthy. Thornhill's quest for vindication and his flight from the law and his would-be murderers lead him from New York's Plaza Hotel to the tree-lined streets of upper-middle class suburban Long Island to the UN building to Chicago's Union Station to a quiet cornfield in Indiana to an auction house back in Chicago and finally to the precipices of Mt.

He has an older brother named Dave and a older sister named Linda. He is an avid musician, who plays in a band called the Pinheads. His best friend is a local scientist named Doc Emmett Brown and he dates Jennifer Parker. He is played by Michael. J. Fox in the Back to the Future Trilogy.While himself not an outcast among teenage high school hangout, Marty is from a family that is portrayed as the most \"uncool\" family one can imagine. His father, George McFly, is a weakling and gets consistently harassed by an old high school bully, and now his boss at work, Biff Tannen. His mother, Lorraine, while being quietly discontent with her husband being such a loser, is at the same time not doing anything about it. Marty's brother Dave and sister Linda are way too weird, which makes Marty the only cool one in the family.Marty's hobbies are music and playing with technological gadgets. His passion for latter makes him find a lot in common with scientist Emmett \"Doc\" Brown and the two are close friends. Brown's life is largely secluded from the local community of Hill Valley, and many consider him a strange man. He is, however, nothing but an unappreciated genius and is ahead of his time in his scientific aspirations due to his unconventional approach. Marty's association with Doc Brown is what fuels the plot when Doc invents the time machine in the form of DMC Delorean automobile. Marty travels through times first into 1955 (Part I), then with Doc into 2015 (Part II). Due to a mess created by Biff during their travel to the future, Marty and Doc have to go back to 1955 to fix it. While taking care of things back in 1955, the Delorean gets struck by lightning with Doc inside at the time, and both Doc and Delorean end up in 1885 because of malfunctioned circuits during the strike. In the Part III, Marty goes to 1885 to try and bring Doc and himself home to 1985.Marty's time travels consistently result in some minor and not so minor changes in him and his family. These changes are a direct result of Marty's and Doc's actions in the past that take effect in the future. For example, Marty helps his father George find inner strength, which changes him as a person. As a result, his family transforms from being a bunch of underachievers into successful people with a lot of self confidence. In addition, Marty gets to meet many of his family members whom he has never known from both past and future and helps them out on a few occasions as well. Among these family members are his children (Part II), maternal grandparents (Part I), great-grandfather and great-great-grandparents (Part III). He also meets some of his relatives that he does know, except he meets them at a different age. For instance, he meets his jailbird uncle Joey as a baby (Part I), his parents as high school teens (Part I and II), his parents as old people (Part II), his wife and himself in the middle age (Part II).Marty's biggest weakness is his inferiority complex, which results in badly damaging Marty's life in the future. It is very easy to challenge Marty to take part in the the most ridiculous fight by calling him \"chicken\", which he cannot stand and negatively responds to right away. This weakness of his becomes well known and his peers try to take advantage of it very often. Marty eventually realizes that this habit has to change for his own sake and does so, but not before putting himself into some dangerous situations.","Emmett \"Doc\" Brown is a local scientist living in the town of Hill Valley. His scientific research and experimentation lies primarily in the field of physics, but also spans across different areas, from nuclear physics to astronomy. It is not very clear whether Doc has a paying job, but it appears unlikely, because Doc does not seem to treat his scientific work as a job, but rather as a field of great interest. Thus, it is possible that at least in 1955 Doc is well provided for, as it is clearly seen in Part I and beginning of Part III, where a large mansion-like structure is pictured as Doc's home. However, the mansion is no longer present in 1985 since it burnt down in 1962 fire and the land it was on was sold to developers. Hence it appears that in 1985 Doc's financial fortunes are no longer so great.Doc devoted most of his life to science, but achieved little success in his work. He is still a scientific genius, and lack of success is mainly due to his sloppiness with little things or the extended reach of his research. Doc's invention of a time machine is obviously a monumental breakthrough, but he keeps it a secret from everyone but Marty whom he is great friends with. Also, the time machine requires a lot of resources that are either expensive or not easily accessible. The time machine itself is a DMC Delorean automobile, and at the core of it there is flux capacitor, a device that channels physical energy into 4-dimensional travel through space-time continuum. Flux capacitor requires 1.2 Gigawatts of electricity in order to function, which is an enormous amount of energy. At the time of the invention, in 1985, Doc plans to generate that energy using plutonium, which he obtains from a Lybian terrorist group but does not pay what they requested and of course gets in trouble for it. In addition, the machine has to accelerate to the speed of 88 mph in order for flux capacitor to get activated, which requires it to use gasoline. That becomes a problem in 1885 (Part III) when the time machine has to be used to return to 1985 at the time when no gas stations are yet in existence.In addition to being a student of many sciences, Doc is also a hopeless romantic. His dream is to live a serene rural life at the time of Old West, which he gets to fully realize when he ends up in 1885 version of Hill Valley, at the time a quintessential Wild West town. Doc handles himself quite well in the atmosphere of weak rule of law and unfamiliar society. He opens his own blacksmith shop, falls in love and ends up not returning to 1985 finally finding his place in life.Doc is completely intolerant to alcohol and cannot handle even a single drink without passing out. Being that at the time of Old West, drinking whiskey is very customary, Doc sometimes ends up taking a drink, each time resulting in his temporary incapacitation. One such time is pictured at the end of Part III, when he and Marty have to catch a train but have to avoid an encounter with Mad Dog Tannen. Doc eventually recovers and after bartender Joey gives him a special \"wake-up juice\", a weird mix of various liquids and Tabasco sauce.","Lorraine Baines was the maiden name of Marty McFly's mother. Her parents were Sam and Stella Baines, her siblings were Sally, Milton and Joey, a.k.a. \"Jailbird\". She married George McFly. They had two sons, Dave and Marty, and a daughter, Linda.She attended Hill Valley High, and was a bit of a flirt. As a teen, she would change her clothes in her room, keeping her window shade open. Boys would watch from a tree across the street, and often fell out of the tree onto the pavement. One of these boys was George McFly.They first kissed at the high school dance \"Enchantment Under the Sea\", and Lorraine knew that they were destined to be together for the rest of their lives.Lorraine and George's youngest son changed their history no fewer than three times.The first time line was a pretty miserable life: Their courtship started when George, while being a Peeping Tom, fell out of the tree, was hit by her father's car and taken into her parents' home.As an adult, Lorraine drank a lot, whined a lot, and was appartenly staying in her marriage out of a sense of not having anything else better to do. A co-worker of George, Biff Tannen, was also causing problems in their lives.The second time-line did not have George falling out of the tree. Instead, he was directed by \"Calvin Kline\" (time-traveller Marty McFly) and a space alien (also Marty) to court Lorainne. George saved Lorraine from Biff's sexual assault and defeated him. At the dance, another bully separated George and Lorraine, but George returned to push him out of the way, kiss Lorraine and win her affection.As adults in this time-line, they were happily married, with Biff having his own car detailing business and referring to George as \"Mr. McFly\".The third time-line she lived in (\"Back to the Future II\") had George McFly dead and Lorraine married to Biff. With great difficulty, Marty was able to correct the time-line back to the second line.","George and Lorraine (nee Baines) McFly had two sons, Dave and Marty, and a daughter, Linda.The McFlys lived in Hill Valley. As a teen, George attended Hill Valley High and was a loner who was at the mercy of school bully Biff Tannen. He was very much into science fiction and was one of many Peeping Toms who would watch Lorraine Baines as she undressed in with her blinds pulled open.His life followed three different time lines.In the first, he fell out of the tree, was hit by Mr. Baines' car, and ended up escorting Lorraine to the school dance, where they kissed for the first time. They ended up married, in a messy, cluttered house, with a junker car and three children, the youngest one named Marty. (The school principal declared all the McFlys as \"losers\". George was still at the mercy of Biff, who was now his co-worker.)Marty accidentally travelled into the past, where he prevented George from getting hit by the car, and almost caused his and his siblings own non-existence.After considerable work by Marty, George saved Lorraine from a sexual assault by Biff, became a hero (and possibly class president) and he and Lorraine went on to have a happy marriage and a successful life with him as famous science fiction author. The older two children also gained success and popularity. Biff ended up having a car detailing business, and was hired to buff George's late-model cars.Unfortunately, a third time-line occurred (\"Back to the Future II\") and George was killed sometime after Marty's birth. Marty corrected the time-line back to the second line.","null","The woman Marty McFly will marry.","null","Linda McFly is the sister of Marty, the main character played by Michael J. Fox.

He and another cop chase a criminal across rooftops of San Francisco, but Scottie slips and nearly falls to his death before grabbing onto a gutter. The other policeman attempts to help Scottie, but his once-latent fear of heights paralyzes him. He can't move when the cop offers his hand to pull him up and he is helpless when the man slips himself and falls to his death.Scottie's troubles are just beginning. A devious old college chum, the dapper Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), learns of Scottie's affliction from the newspapers and exploits it in a plot to murder his wife and make it look like an accident. But Scottie knows nothing of this. He falls in love with the woman (Kim Novak) he believes to be Madeleine Elster, Gavin's wife. After Madeleine seems to die in suicidal leap that his acrophobia prevents him from stopping, Scottie has a nervous breakdown.He recovers, only to find Madeleine's look-alike, Judy (also Kim Novak), with whom he begins a romance. He remakes Judy into a perfect duplicate of Madeleine--forcing her to wear the same clothes, makeup and hair. But he soon learns that \"Madeleine\" and Judy are the same person. The woman he knew as Madeleine was a fake; and the real Madeleine, whom he had never met, was a victim of murder, not suicide. The murderer was Gavin Elster; his accomplice was Judy.To exorcise his demons, Scottie brings Judy back to the church tower, the scene of the crime. Scottie had tried to follow Judy, not Madeleine, up those steps; but it was the real Madeleine who had fallen after Gavin had broken her neck and thrown her from the top of the tower. Scottie re-enacts the crime, but an accident sends Judy hurtling to her death, an ironic fate for a woman who had once posed as the luckless victim of the same fall. We see Scottie looking down at the broken Judy, spreading out his arms as if he were about to leap himself and join his dead lover.The movie ends at this point, and we never learn what happens to Scottie, the half-responsible witness to three deadly falls. A deleted scene, available as a bonus feature on the movie's DVD, shows us Scottie and his friend Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) sitting in her apartment, listening to the radio on which a newscaster is describing the fate of Gavin Elster. Hitchcock wanted this scene removed for a reason: it's better for us to wonder about Scottie's fate. We're free to consider this scene as irrelevant to this story as are the very different set of events in the original novel, D'entre les mort by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac.","null","The Madeleine character of Vertigo is a fabrication from the start, a fact that is not known until two-thirds of the way into the film when it is revealed that Judy impersonated Madeleine in a scheme to murder the real Madeleine Elster. It is a fact that unmoors viewers as it means that Madeleines apparent motivations, haunted dreams, memories, and even mannerisms have been externally created by Judy in collaboration with Elster. Madeleine is the perfect representation of the world of romantic illusion to which Scottie is tragically attracted. It is difficult to discus s what motivates Madeleine because she is no more than a projection. Judy, on the other hand, is a real person, complete with imperfections, complex feelings, and motivations. Where Madeleine represents the unattainable ideal, Judy represents the real. The only point at which Judy and Madeleine converge is in their love for Scottie.Judys manners are unrefined, even a bit coarse. In short, she is the antithesis of the refined, ethereal Madeleine. But Scottie recognizes some echo of Madeleine in Judy and relentlessly quizzes her about her identity. At first, Judy defends her true self, repeating her name, the name of her hometown in Kansas, and her occupation. In retrospect, we see that she is probably desperate to reclaim her true identity after having played the role of Madeleine for so long. When it becomes clear to Judy that Scottie will never love her for her own attributes, she consciously surrenders herself and allows him to transform her into Madeleine. Indeed, by the time her transformation is complete, it seems that rather than playing a role, Judy has actually taken on Madeleines identity, a fact that would account for her unthinking and fatal choice of Carlottas necklace when she dresses for dinner.In Hitchcock's Vertigo, Judy must die for the sake of narrative resolution as, while Scottie desires her, she disturbs his need for mastery. Madeleine often appears through a doorway, indicating that theres something behind her, in her past that is only partially visible to us, and to Scottie.","A secondary character in Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, Midge, played by Barbera Bel Geddis, plays the role of Jimmy Stwart's confidant and friend. In the film she is a designer of Lingerie who listens to Jimmy's problems and tries to come up with solutions.As the film progresses it would appear that she starts to fall for Stewart's character (Scotty) and she becomes jealous of his constant infatuation with Kim Novak's enigmatic character (Madeline). She eventually puts her profession on the back burners to paint a self portrait for Scotty, which he finds offensive.The movie is really not about Midge. She serves a purpose for the viewer and then largely dissapears from the plot. However she remains faithful to Scotty throughout.Where Madeleine represents a romantic, otherworldly ideal, Midge stands for its opposite. The bespectacled Midge is practical, competent, realistic, and well adjusted. An artist by training, she applies her skill to prosaic ends, creating advertisements for womens undergarments. Throughout the film, she attempts to keep Scotties feet on the ground. First, she tries to change Scotties mind about giving up his detective job and works on helping him overcome his acrophobia. When he begins his job trailing Madeleine, Midge attempts to unmask the improbability of the situation. Her constant attempts to make Scottie discuss the case reveal her desire to ground the mystery in reality and his unwillingness to do so. Scottie considers Midges treatment of Madeleines world to be a kind of blasphemy, and it becomes clear to Midge that she will find no entrance into that world. It is significant that the last shot of Midge is of her retreating down the hall of the sanatorium. She has been unable to bring Scottie out of his catatonic state and back to reality. He is now firmly entrenched in the world of illusion, beyond the reach of the real world.Midge identifies herself at least three times as \"mother.\" \"Mother's here,\" she says to Scottie in the mental hospital. While Midge flirtingly discusses the architecture of the brassiere (her banter is bright but all on the surface, despite her deep feelings; shes \"a known quantity,\" in Woods words), Madeleine is introduced as a mystery woman.Midge herself contrasts markedly with Madeleine; Hitchcocks assessment of her is a sympathetic portrait: Midge is practical, realistic, emancipated, positive and healthy in her outlook. But from the outset the inadequacies revealed later are hinted it these flaws make here a more sympathetic\/realistic character. A trained artist she devotes her energies to sketching advertisements for brassieres. Entirely devoid of mystery or reserve, the kind of sexuality she represents is suggested by her smart sex-chat about corsets and brassieres (You know about those things, youre a big boy now) again reflecting her mothering attitude.","In Vertigo, shipping magnate Gavin Elster, perhaps the only movie villain to be called Gavin, carries out a fiendish plan to murder his wife by throwing her from a church tower. In order to make it look like suicide, he has an impersonator (Kim Novak) play the part of his wife, and hires a detective (James Stewart) to follow her around, counting on the mans fear of heights to prevent him from pursuing her to the top of the tower.The plan is brilliant in its simplicity. Nothing left to chance. And it would have worked, too, if the detective had not fallen in love with the impersonator, then met her again after the scheme had been carried out, failed to recognise her as the same woman, but noted her resemblance and tried to make her over, before figuring it out and chasing her to her death up the same clock tower.Vertigo however is totally uninterested in Elster as a figure or a narrative agent. What matters is the uncanny way in which Scotty takes on Elsters identity and performs the same actions as he did. But what Elster wanted was money and power, what Scottie wants is passionate, deeply felt romantic love.The opening scene in his office(Bumsteads designs impressed Hitchcock so much he insisted that he recreate his office as a replica) is probably the most overt political subtext where Elster waxes nostalgia for the old days of San Francisco when men could do whatever they wanted as they had the money and the power then. Hitchcock however shows how a normal, average good guy destroys a woman.","null","null","The unnamed proprietress (Ellen Corby) of the McKittrick Hotel figures in the most mysterious scene of Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958).Scottie (James Stewart) is a retired police detective following Madeleine (Kim Novak), the wife of an old college chum who claims he's worried she's going mad. Scottie sees her enter the hotel and then open the curtains of her room. Then he enters the hotel himself and asks the proprietress some questions about Madeleine, whom he discovers is renting the room under the name of Carlotta Valdes.

Mireau then passes the task of taking the Ant Hill on to his best and most trusted regimental commander Colonel Dax, who makes the same arguments about the Ant Hill being too difficult an objective, and his Regiment being badly under strength.Three companies from Dax's regiment are charged with the first wave of the assault against the Ant Hill. When the attack begins, one of the companies refuses to leave their trenches in the face of stronger than expected German resistance. As incentive to get them to leave their trenches, Mireau gives the artillery commander a controversial order to shell their own positions. The order is refused by the artillery commander, and the entire attack eventually fails.Mireau is outraged by the failure, and demands that all three of the companies in the first wave of the assault be shot for cowardice. After some negotiations between Mireau, Broulard and Dax, they agree that only three men, one from each company, will be put on trial for cowardice, and that Dax (a reserve officer and lawyer in civilian life) will act as their defense attorney. The trial is merely a show-trial, however, with the execution of the three men being a foregone conclusion. In a last ditch effort to save the their lives, Dax threatens to blackmail Broulard by going public with the information about Mireau's artillery order if Broulard doesn't commute the death sentence on the three men. In the end, Broulard allows the three men to be executed anyway, and then uses the information about Mireau's order to bring down Mireau as well. Mireau protests to Broulard by saying \"so, you're making me the goat, the only truly innocent man in this whole affair. I have only one last thing to say to you, George. The man you stabbed in the back is a soldier.\"Mireau is portrayed less as a villain than as a man who makes inhumane decisions as a result of the inflexibility of his character.","null","null","null","null","null","Pvt.

The toy line included a variety of merchandise such as lunchboxes, record players, posters and set scenes. The line featured other characters, notably Bullseye, Woody's horse; Jessie, the Yodeling Cowgirl; and Stinky Pete, the Prospector. These characters, along with Woody, were part of a TV series also called Woody's Roundup. The immense popularity of both the series and the toy line declined rapidly in the late 1950s and early 1960s following the launch of Sputnik, the rise of the space age and related toy lines. The entire Roundup gang is extremely rare and collectible, particularly Woody, who is worth a large amount even in less than mint condition.The Toy Story movie series focuses on the adventures of one Woody doll (who is never referred to with his last name), who comes to life when humans aren't around. For the near entirety of the movie series, Woody is owned by an imaginative boy named Andy. Andy's father, who is never named, first got Woody as a young boy in the late 1950s. Andy's father then gave Woody to his son when Andy entered kindergarten in the late 1980s. Woody is called an old family toy and one of the son's few links to his father, who died shortly after the birth of his daughter, Molly.In the first Toy Story installment, Woody struggles with losing Andy's interest to a space toy named Buzz Lightyear. In an adventure where Woody and Buzz become lost and fall into the hands of a destructive child named Sid, Woody and Buzz learn accept their limitations, becoming close friends in the process. Woody moves into his new role among Andy's toys -- as something of a patriarch -- and decides to be there for his owner, no matter how often Andy chooses to play with him.In the second Toy Story installment, Woody struggles with his own mortality after he starts to rip apart after decades of play. He mainly is concerned Andy will throw him in the trash, having outlived his usefulness. Woody initially thinks he found salvation after a toy salesman named Al stole Woody for his Woody's Roundup collection, which also includes Bullseye, Jessie and Stinky Pete. Al intends to sell his collection to a Japanese toy museum, where Woody believes he'll be adored by children for generations. However, after Buzz leads a contingent of Andy's toys on a rescue mission to Al's apartment, Woody is convinced his true role is for play and to be loved by his owner. Woody persuades Bullseye and Jessie to join him as Andy's toys.Woody's trials and shaped beliefs in the first two Toy Story installments are vital in the third installment, where he must help Andy's other toys as they struggle with losing Andy's interest and their own mortality.In the third Toy Story installment, Woody struggles with his loyalties to both Andy and his other toys, who become convinced Andy wants to throw them away. When Buzz, Jessie and the rest of Andy's toys decide to move into a daycare center, Woody initially opts to return to Andy. However, when Woody learns the daycare center is really a place of ruin and despair, he returns to rescue Buzz, Jessie and the rest of his friends. During their escape efforts, the toys decide their place is by Andy's side and return to his house, even if that means decades spent in his attic. After overhearing a conversation between Andy and his mother, Woody realizes the toys' true roles are as a child's playthings and writes a note to Andy that he donate his toys to a worthy child, rather than file them away in the attic. Andy gives all his toys, including Woody, to an imaginative girl named Bonnie, who Woody had met briefly during his earlier separation from the rest of Andy's toys. As Bonnie's toy, Woody once again assumes his role as patriarch of the other toys.Throughout all the Toy Story installments and supporting media, Woody displays his leadership, caring and loyalty toward other toys, and -- above all -- a desire to love and by loved by his owner, which are traits similar to those display during his stint on Woody's Roundup.","A loyal, brave and romantic space toy.

She had a daughter, Amanda Ripley MacLaren, and no other descendants (not counting her clone in Alien Resurrection).In 2122, Ripley was employed as Warrant Officer (Ident Number W5645022460H) for the Weyland-Yutani corporation, working on the USCSS Nostromo, which was towing massive quantities of raw ore to Earth from Thedus.Along with the rest of the crew, she was awakened 10 months prematurely from hypersleep by Mother, the ship's computer, to answer a curious transmission received from moon LV-426.[1] Upon landing, Executive Officer Kane, Captain Dallas, and Navigator Lambert disembarked and investigated the source of the transmission a derelict alien space craft. While investigating the derelict craft, an alien parasite attached itself to Executive Officer Kane.Ripley initially refused to allow the landing party back onto the ship after they were injured, citing quarantine regulations. Her order was ignored by Science Officer Ash, whom she began to distrust more and more as time went on. The bypassing of quarantine had serious consequences when an extraterrestrial larva or embryo of some kind deposited by the \"facehugger\" that attacked Kane matured and erupted from his chest. Kane was killed by this alien birth, and the creature quickly took to preying upon the rest of the crew.Following the presumed death of Dallas, Ripley became the Nostromo's commanding officer, and learned from Mother the final piece of the puzzle: Special Order 937, a secret Company policy to study the very creature that was stalking them at the expense of their lives. With the crew around her dwindling just as quickly as the creature seemed to be growing, Ripley began the vessel's self-destruct sequence. The Nostromo, the cooling rods removed from its reactor, melted down and exploded violently, moments after Ripley (in the escape ship Narcissus) reached safety. She was expecting to be rescued within a few weeks, but she and her cat Jones would drift \"right through the core systems\" and spend the next 57 years in hypersleep. Ripley's only daughter, Amanda, died at the age of 66, just two years before Ripley would be found and awoken from hypersleep. A photograph shown in a brief clip in the special edition of Aliens (1986) has her date of death listed as \"12.23.20\", but a later line from Carter Burke places the events of the same film 57 years later (2179).After her subsequent rescue by a salvage crew, Ripley was made a Lieutenant and reluctantly returned to LV-426 with a team of United States Colonial Marines to rescue the colonists of Hadley's Hope, and basically became the unit's de facto leader after most of the marines were killed. Ripley escaped with one colonist, an injured marine, half of an android, and (unbeknownst to her) a super-facehugger (Emperess class : Multi-embryo producing organism, awakened only when the death of the current Alien Queen is unavoidable). She subsequently found herself marooned on Fiorina \"Fury\" 161, an outer-veil mineral ore refinery and correctional facility, where she died while trying to prevent Weyland-Yutani from getting its hands on the alien queen that was inside of her.Various clones of Ellen Ripley were later created by the military for the purpose of experimentation with the alien. (See Alien: Resurrection (1997)) The protagonist clone, Ellen Ripley 8 has traces of xenomorph genes inside of her that gave her superior strength, endurance, caustic blood and the ability to sense and communicate with the creatures. Due to some form of \"genetic memory\" derived from the aliens the Ripley clone could learn at an extremely rapid rate and recall some of the original's memories and personality. The clone was not an exact mental duplicate as she was more violent, fatalistic and sadistic than the original. She also had a mild empathy for the xenomorphs and antipathy for humans.Ripley 8 discovered the seven experimental, deformed clone Ripleys in a military lab. At the pleading of the last surviving one (Ripley 7) she incinerated the lab and all the clones with a flamethrower.","Rebecca \"Newt\" Jorden was a small girl living with her parents and brother Timmy in the colony on LV-426, Hadley's Hope. She was about 7 years old and was in the second grade. Her family was the first to investigate the crashed derelict ship carrying alien eggs and her father was infested by them. Soon, they spread through the colony and Newt was able to survive by hiding in the vents, as other children did until the aliens killed them and Newt was the only survivor. Newt carried a little doll head with her everywhere named Casey, which was her only possession. Due to her experience, she became severely traumatized and suffered from nightmares.She was rescued by the marines and Ripley when they arrived. Ripley and Newt soon developed a mother-daughter relationship. Newt and Ripley were the only people who had faced an alien and survive for a while. They were almost impregnated by facehuggers when Carter Burke let them loose in the med lab, luckily the were saved by the marines and the facehuggers were destroyed. When the aliens attacked, Newt was able to lead the survivors to safety however the aliens followed them, killing everyone except her, Ripley and Corporal Dwayne Hicks. Newt was captured by an alien warrior when she fell down an air shaft during an explosion in the vents. Ripley refused to leave Newt behind so she went back to the nest to rescue her. Ripley managed to save her from a facehugger but were stopped in their tracks when they came face to face with the Alien Queen. Ripley destroyed the Queen's nest and escaped with Newt to the marine's drop ship seconds before the planet exploded. When they got back to the Sulaco they found the Alien Queen, who had stowed away on the ship. While Ripley distracted the Queen, Newt ran away and hid under the floor, the Queen found and attacked her. Just before the Queen was about to grab Newt, Ripley came in a Power Loader and fought it off and blew it out of the airlock, Newt was almost sucked into space herself but the android Bishop was able to save her. After Ripley reached safety, she and Newt shared a special moment in the film when Newt called her \"mommy\". Newt went into cryogenic sleep with the rest of the survivors, which were only her, Ripley, Bishop (who had been torn apart by the Alien Queen) and Hicks (who was wounded by alien acid blood).Tragically, Newt was killed in the crash of the EEV when it crashed onto the prison planet Fiorina-161, nicknamed \"Fury\". Ripley convinced the prisoners to cremate Newt and Hicks (who also died in the crash) in case the aliens had implanted embryos in them. Although there are those who believe Alien 3 to be canon there are others who, mainly because of the amount of plot holes and inconsistencies in the series think of Alien 3 as nothing more than a bad dream of Ripleys. if this were true then it can be assumed that Newt still lives on as the Sulaco floats back to earth.Newt was played by Carrie Henn in Aliens.","Corporal Dwayne Hicks is a colonial marine who is sent to planet LV-426 to find out why contact with that colony was lost, with his team acting under the supervision of the inexperienced Lt. Gorman. While examining the underground complex, most of his team is killed or captured by the Aliens, save for the bad tempered Private Vasquez and cynical, cowardly Private Hudson, as they are rescued by Ellen Ripley. After realizing that they cannot defeat the Aliens or rescue their teammates, Hicks, now commanding officer, orders that they leave the planet and nuke the site, but an Alien gets on board the drop ship that was meant to take them back up, stranding them with limited supplies. With 17 days to go before a rescue team is dispatched, Hicks does his best to keep his surviving team mates calm, with help from Ripley, whom he seems to be attracted to. As a quiet bonding moment, Hicks shows Ripley how to work the pulse rifles. Hicks and his team rescue Ripley and Newt (another survivor) from being impregnated by Alien face huggers, a plot by the evil company man Carter Burke to both kill Ripley and bring back specimens for Weyland-Yutani, which funded the colony and sent the marines in. Upon learning this, the normally calm Hicks opted to essentially murder Burke in retaliation and to protect the other survivors, but before he could actually kill Burke, the Aliens attacked, killing Burke, presumably killing Hudson, and resulting in the suicides of Vasquez and Gorman (to avoid impregnation). While trying to escape the complex, Hicks was injured by an Alien that attacked him and Ripley in an elevator; on reflex, Hicks shot the Alien, but the creature's acid blood splattered all over Hicks. Ripley managed to drag Hicks out of the complex and left him in the drop ship while she went to rescue Newt. Bishop stabilized Hicks's vital signs and kept him alive.Tragically, Hicks died when the drop ship crashed on a prison planet and he was impaled by his own flight harness within in his sleep capsule. Ripley convinced the warden to have Hicks and Newt (who was killed in the crash as well) cremated in case alien embryos survived in their bodies. There are those who believe that, because of the huge number of inconsistencies and plot holes in ALien 3 that it is nothing more than a bad dream of Ripleys and that Hicks survives on in the Sulaco.","null","Bishop is a \"synthetic,\" an android, although he prefers the term \"artificial person\" himself. He is a new model, which has been given behavioral inhibitors which force him to act in compliance with Isaac Asimov's First Law of Robotics (\"A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm\"). It is unclear whether or not he has been modified to comply with the second two. He has been assigned as support to the Colonial Marine squadron aboard the Sulaco.When the team is ordered to LV-426, Bishop encounters Ellen Ripley for the first time, and accepts her prejudice against artificial people with grace, agreeing to \"stay away from her.\" Later, his loyalty and bravery cause her to revise her opinion, and she comes to respect androids more than the human beings who created them.The Marines from the Sulaco along with Ripley, Bishop, and company executive Burke set down on LV-426 and discover that Aliens have killed almost all of the colonists. The Aliens then kill Burke and most of the Marine contingent. Bishop does not engage in combat, however, instead acting as a medic and tending to other support functions. Bishop saves Ripley, Newt, and Corporal Hicks by piloting their dropship out of the exploding atmosphere processing station. However, upon landing on the Sulaco, Bishop is ripped in half by the Alien queen that had attached itself to the dropship. When Ripley opens the airlock to expel the Alien queen into space, Bishop saves himself and Newt. Afterward, he is placed in hypersleep with Ripley, Newt, and Hicks.","null","null","null","null","null","Private Frost, played by Ricco Ross, is one of the more major colonial marines who are sent out to LV-426.

Similar to her boyfriend, playwright Georg Dreyman, she is sympathetic to the dissident views of many East German artists while also making certain concessions to the Socialist party. She goes a step further than Dreyman, however, in that she takes favors from party leaders and submits to other corrupt demands in order to preserve her status as the darling actress of the GDR. With somber reluctance, she accepts this arrangement as a necessary evil for the sake of her art. But this sacrifice will come at a cost that could include estrangement from Dreyman.","Gerd Wiesler is a captain of East German secret police Stasi. He is a master of interrogation process and also teaches interrogation techniques at Stasi school. His supervisor, Oberstleutenant Anton Grubitz, assigns him to monitor the apartment of the playwright Georg Dreyman, who is suspected in some dissident activities. The real reason that the Stasi wants to keep an eye on Dreyman is that he is in love with Christa-Maria Sieland, who is also a love interest of corrupt East German minister Bruno Hempf. While performing the assignment, Wiesler finds himself emotionally connected to the world that Dreyman lives in and being more and more disappointed in the system that he serves. He tries to invisibly aid Dreyman to not get caught, and at the same time to stay from being caught himself.","Georg Dreyman is a major playright in GDR. His plays are popular in part due to the fact that he tries not to stir any controversy with party leadership that censors all the plays. Some of Dreyman's close friends, however, are forbidden from work, because they fell into disgrace with the officials. Because of this, Dreyman is becoming more disparate from his earlier safe stands. However, even his clean past does not save him from the cruelty of the system as minister Hempf gets the Stasi to monitor his apartment. Hempf is trying to dig up dirt on Dreyman so that he can get Dreyman's girlfriend, actress Christa-Maria Sieland all to himself.Dreyman is a member of a close cultural circle, where dissident moods are frequent, but still not very organized at the time the events take place. The might of state security is humbling among his friends and most of them seem to realize that there is very little they can do. Even though Dreyman eventually realizes that he has to resist the system himself, he chooses to do it anonymously via a Western publication.","Anton Grubitz is a high rank Stasi officer and a professor in Stasi school. He is about the same age as his subordinate Gerd Wiesler. He is less talented and detail oriented than Wiesler, but he advanced faster professionally because of his ability to be a politician in a workplace and easy adaptation to corrupt nature of Stasi. He does not care much about integrity of his work, but rather about visibility of success so that he can advance closer to the top ranks.

He was the son of Meridius, the governor of the province, and of Lucretia, the daughter of the Roman Senator Bodaus.He was sent to school at the age of eight to Hispalis, and studied under the tutelage of Fulvus, the stoic philospher. He joined the army at 17 as a Standard Bearer.He fought in campaigns against the Celts in Britannia and against the Parthians in Cappadocia. Honored for his bravery under the fire of battle, he moved up through the ranks as optio, centurion, and then as primus pilus of the First Cohort under General Lucius Veras.Earlier, in AD 171, while visiting the villa of Sergius Manus, a wealthy landowner in the Spanish province of Gemina, he fell in love with Sergius's daughter Cecilia.Maximus and Cecilia married, and had a son named Decimus after his grandfather. They settled on a working farm in the hills of Fulginia, several day's ride from Rome. The farm sat on a hillside, and giant poplars lined its entry road. Although he wasn't able to see his family near as often as he like he wrote to them and said prayers for them on a constant basis.Marcus Aurelius, a friend of Maximus's father and father-in-law, appointed him Legate of the Emperor's Legion in AD 176. He was the youngest general so appointed in Roman history.He led the army against the Veture in Gaul and the Marcomanni in Germania. He was away for four years until the final victory against the barbarians near the river Danube.In Germania, behind closed doors, Marcus Aurelius asked Maximus to be Caeser after his death. He died before he could tell anyone other than Maximus or Commodus about the new heir. Commodus, upon learning that he would not be Caeser, smothered his own father.After Marcus Aurelius' death in the camp, Maximus was arrested by the guards of the 'new Caeser' Commodus. Suspecting that Commodus was the one who committed the murder, the general had refused to give allegiance to the new Caeser. As he was about to be executed, Maximus overwhelmed his guards and escaped.In his so-called 'vengence' efforts Commodus had the general's family and retainers brutally murdered.Maximus returned home after much travel and found his loved ones hung. He fainted from exaustion, sorrow and his wounds, and was captured by marauding thieves while asleep.He was sold to the old gladiator Proximo taking the name of \"The Spainiard.\"Vowing revenge against Commodus, he fought in many battles in stadiums all over the Roman world -- his fame gaining all the while -- finally coming to the Coliseum in Rome in AD 187.He died in the Coliseum in AD 187 at age 40, after defeating and killing Commodus in a battle in the arena. (He had been secretly stabbed by Commodus beforehand while still tied as a prisoner.) The Roman mob cheered his victory and hailed him as a hero. His dying wish to return Rome to a democracy was honored.","Commodus is a character based on Lucius Aurelius Commodus who lived from 161 to 192 and was the son of the reigning Ceasar Marcus Aurelius. After his father died, he acceded to power over of the Roman empire from 180 until his death - he wasn't very popular with his subjects during his reign. He is portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator (2000) under the single name, \"Commodus\". Gladiator must not be taken as the Truth Be Told as it as only an approximation of true events.In the movie, Gladiator, he was emotionally wounded and desperately wanted to be loved and respected. He was very sure he was going to become emperer of all Rome when his father ceded the throne. However when his father told him his old nemesis, Maximus, was going to be emperer instead of himself, Commodus lost control, and he was so humiliated that his father should have been witness to his uncontrolled emotions, that he smothered his father to death. Which had an added benefit - nobody would know that Marcus Aurelius hadn't given him the crown and he, Commodus, could be emperer in spite of his father's wishes. When Maximus later refused to kiss his hand, Commodus ordered him killed. (hey, he was the emperer; he could do that) So the soldiers took him out into the bushes and reported back that they killed Maximus and his family.Thus began a reign of comedic proportions with Maximus out of the way (or so Commodus thought) Meanwhile, Commodus went along merrily thinking all was good. He ordered 300 days of gladiatorial fights to honor his father. The people in the towns feared Commodus and ridiculed him at the same time.One day at one of the gladiatorial exercises, one they called the Spaniard, did an outstanding job at chopping up people. Commodus said to his hand servent, \"I think I will meet him.\" So Commodus went down into the arena to meet this guy and asked him his name. \"My name is Spaniard\" \"No your real name. Certainly you have a name.\" Ahh, Spaniard will do and he turned around to leave and Commodus was enraged. \"How dare you turn your back to me! Take off your mask and tell me your name.\" So Spaniard turned around slowly took off his mask and said, \"My name is Maximus Decimas Meridius, commander of the armies of the North, General of the Felix nation, loyal servant to Marcus Aurelius, father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and I will have my vengence in this life or the next.\" Case closed.Well, needless to say, Commodus was floored and had a temper tantrum in the basement where he hacked at his father's bust. Later that day, he complained to his sister (Lucilla), \"They lied when they told me he was dead. If they lied, how can they respect me. If they don't respect me, how can they love me?\" . Well, he went about killing the two who lied to him. (They were disrespectful in lying to him, they had to be shot. No matter that they'd have been shot if they came back and reported Maximus was yet alive.)So Commodus went about on his plans to kill Maximus with more and more obstacles in the arena. He brought out the tigers. Max slew the tigers. He brought out Tigris from Gall and Max did him in. He even tried to goad Maximus into reacting so he'd have a reason to tell the guards to attack this unarmed guy-that didn't work either. Maximus kept coming out the winner in these conflicts. The culmination of all this came when Maximus had Tigris on the ground and when Commodus gave the thumbs down sign to finish the guy off, Maximus spat and said \"forget you\" and walked off. This really brought out the crowd approval out with huge hollers and yells as the common belief of the crowd was one of disapproval of Commodus. Hey take that you - emperor. Well Commodus didn't know what to do. If he ordered Maximus killed now, he would be a martyr. This whole thing stunk of some putrid disease. His right hand man, Falco advised keeping his enemies closer. Really? hmmm that might be a good idea.Meanwhile Lucilla, Gracchus and Maximus plotted together to overthrow the current government but Commodus found out about it and the plan was foiled and Maximus jailed. Commodus went to Maximus who was held in the basement and told him he would fight him and then stabbed Maximus in his kidney, mortally wounding him. This time, Maximus would be unable to fight and Commodus would win the respect of everyone when Maximus was massacred. But alas Commodus' plans of grandiosity were foiled once again when Maximus (even though he was mortally wounded) was able to stick a knife in his jugular vein and as life slowly ebbed out of Commodus, he had an incredulous look on his face (Max should have been the one to be defeated-how on earth did this happen). Max held onto him as he died then dropped him onto the floor of the arena like a sack of flour.","null","Oliver Reed's last performance as Proximus the freed slave, was astounding. He embodies the wisdom of the old warrior who does not only think about his own interests, but deep inside cares about those who risk their lives for his own profit.Proximus is the one who purchases Maximus as a slave and helps him to become a Gladiator's Gladiator. His advice and help would proof to be priceless. He tells Maximus: \"Win the crowd Spaniard.... and perhaps you shall win your freedom.\"Before the movie ended Mr. Reed died, this put additional challenges in telling the story, but director Ridley Scott found innovative ways to film the final lines of one of the top character depictions ever.","Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus, often referred to as \"the wise\", (April 26, 121-March 17, 180) was Roman Emperor from 161 to his death in 180. He was the last of the \"Five Good Emperors\", and is also considered one of the most important Stoic philosophers. His tenure was marked by wars in Asia against a revitalized Parthian Empire, and with Germanic tribes along the Limes Germanicus into Gaul and across the Danube.

After questioning and beating the cop for some time, Vic is left alone with the cop. It is revealed that Vic carries a straight razor in his boot, which he uses to torture and deform the police officer.

He was born into poverty and squalor in a Jewish enclave in Brooklyn, New York City.David Aaronson later formed a gang with his friends Phillip \"Cock Eye\" Stein, Patrick \"Patsy\" Goldberg and a young boy named Dominic. Together they rolled drunks in a bar run by a local mobster named Bugsy that they worked for and helped in maintaining his protection racket.In 1921 David \"Noodles\" Aaronson and his gang were about to roll a drunk when Maximillian \"Max\" Bercovicz takes their chance by helping the drunk onto the back of his carridge and pretending to know him. Noodles later came across Max as he was moving into his new house. Max and Noodles size each other up and Max flaunts the pocket watch he stole from the drunk which Noodles then steals from him. A corrupt cop known as Fart Face locally \"requisitions\" the item from the two boys. Noodles then helped Max finish moving his items into his house. The two had suffered a mutual defeat and became running Aaronson's gang as partners.Noodles and Max later take a photograph of Fart Face whilst he was having sex with an underage prostitute named Peggy they then had Patsy hide it and made their intentions to black mail Fart Face apparent to him. First they had him pay for their \"turns\" with Peggy. Noodles then made his intentions to use Fart Face to cover up his gang activities and Fart Face scoffed at the idea knowing that they were operating in a neighbourhood run by Bugsy, who had a far superior criminal enterprise to them.Noodles and Max were later beaten up by Bugsy and some of his underlings for operating independently from him in his neighbourhood. Noodles and Max later met with the Capuano brothers, successful bootleggers. Noodles shows them a technique of saving their shipments of booze when the coast guard forces them to throw all cargo overboard. A package of salt is tied to the crate of booze along with a balloon like sphere containing air. The crate sunk to bottom of the river and when the salt had dissolved the crates float back to the surface, by then the coast guards had left and Aaronson's gang picked up the crates.Noodles and Max's gang saved the Capuanos shipment and received a 10% cut of the profits made from the shipment. Noodles, Max, Patsy, Cock Eye and Dominic left the Capuanos warehouse. They made their way to the trainstation were they stashed 50% of their profits in a suitcase hidden within a locker there.On there way home from the trainstation they were chased by Bugsy who opened fire on them killing Dominic, while the others disappeared into the surrounding scenary and Bugsy began to stalk the young boys eager to shoot all of the remaining gang members. Bugsy makes his move to murder Patsy and was ambushed by Noodles, who stabs him repeatedly almost disembowelling him. However, Bugsy managed to squeeze off one last round that alerted nearby police officers to the scene. Max, Patsy and Cock Eye watched helplessly as Noodles murdered Bugsy and then took on two police officers, stabbing one and then being battered unconscious by his partner.Noodles was presumably found guilty of voluntary manslaughter or murder as well as assaulting an officer. Noodles was then sent to prison.Noodles was released from prison in 1933 after serving 12 years and was picked up by Max Bercovicz. Noodles was soon working with his old gang.Max introduced Noodles to mobster Frankie Minaldi who gave him and his gang an assignment to rob a Detroit jeweller of some jewels and kill Joe from Detroit. The gang executed the job with violent ease, Noodles sodomized the woman who gave Joe from Detroit the information needed to pull off the job. They later shot Joe from Detroit and his gang in a car, as ordered to by Frankie Minaldi. Noodles personally gunned down one of Joe's henchmen who had escaped the car and fled into a factory.","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"],"ImageURL":["http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTk1MDY1NjE4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzEyMzE0NA@@._V1._SX640_SY899_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BODEzNjAyNjk0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDEyMzE0NA@@._V1._SX640_SY457_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTg0ODI0MjcxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzEyMzE0NA@@._V1._SX640_SY469_.jpg","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null"],"Name":["David 'Noodles' Aaronson","Maximilian 'Max' Bercovicz","Deborah Gelly","Frankie Manoldi","Joe","Carol","James Conway O'Donnell","Police Chief Vincent Aiello","Chicken Joe","Patrick 'Patsy' Goldberg","Philip 'Cockeye' Stein","Eve\n\n                \n                (as Darlanne Fleugel)","'Fat' Moe Gelly","Officer 'Fartface' Whitey\n\n                \n                (as Richard Foronji)"]},"76":{"Actor":[],"Bio":[],"ImageURL":[],"Name":[]}},"Link":"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0087843\/","Title":"Once Upon a Time in America"},{"Characters":{"0":{"Actor":["Jack Nicholson","Faye Dunaway","John Huston","Perry Lopez","John Hillerman","Darrell Zwerling","Diane Ladd","Roman Polanski"],"Bio":["JJ Gittes, aka, \"Jake\", is a Los Angeles private detective.

So Mufasa teaches his son about being king and shows him the whole kingdom.Eventually, Mufasa saves Simba and Nala from Shenzi, Banzai and Ed after being alerted by Zazu. Mufasa scolds Simba for almost getting him and Nala killed, but Simba said he was only trying to be brave like him; but Mufasa reveals he's only brave when he has to be.One day, Mufasa's younger brother Scar plots to kill him and Simba, with help from the hyenas. After giving the signal to Shenzi, Banzai and Ed, they cause a wildebeest stampede, in which Simba is almost killed, but is saved in time by Mufasa, who was alerted by Scar. With Simba watching on a safe hill, Mufasa struggles to climb his way back up. He sees Scar at the top and tells him to save him. But Scar grabs Mufasa with his claws (thus making him roar in pain), and with a wicked smile, Scar whispers, \"Long live the king!\". Horrified, Mufasa realizes Scar's true feelings toward him and he lets go of his brother, sending him flying into the stampede, thus getting trampled and killed. When Simba goes down to help his dad, he soon realizes he's dead and begins to cry. Scar shows up and tricks Simba into believing he caused his father's death and told him to run away and never return. He then sends Shenzi, Banzai and Ed to kill Simba, to which they fail, unbeknownst to Scar.Many years pass, and Simba is now an adult and afraid to go back home and confront Scar. But eventually, the ghost of Mufasa appears in the night sky and gives Simba confindence and tells him to remember who he is.

At the end, Mufasa tells Simba that he's proud of him after Kiara and Kovu get married.In The Lion King 1\u00bd, we see Mufasa's story from Timon and Pumbaa's point of view, and they riff on Mufasa's scenes like how Mike, Joel, and the Bots used to do in Mystery Science Theater 3000.He also appeared as a guest in House of Mouse.Mufasa's ghost appears again in Kingdom Hearts II to once again give Simba confidence, and he has a flashback where he remembers what Mufasa told him about the stars when he was a kid.His character was similar to another character James Earl Jones played in Coming to America.Mufasa was voiced by James Earl Jones and by Keith David in House of Mouse.","Scar (formerly Prince Taka) was the main antagonist of the Lion King franchise.

Vincennes gradually awakens to Sid's part in a plot reaching into the L.A.P.D. to take over L.A.'s criminal activity following the incarceration of Mickey Cohen, and joins with Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) to fight it.","Wendell \"Bud\" White grew up the son of an abusive, alcoholic father, who used to beat his wife and son. As Bud got bigger, he tried to protect his mother, and one night his father chained him to a radiator then beat his mother to death with a tire iron. Bud vowed to himself that he would protect women from such brutes, but as he grew up, he realized he possessed the same brutish anger. Instead of turning it on women, however, he turned it on their abusers. Always on the lookout for damsels in distress, Bud has earned a reputation on the LA police force as a punisher of wife-beaters. His tough tactics attract the attention of Captain Dudley Smith, who recruits him as an enforcer for his attempt at taking over the LA drug racket.

After becoming a detective lieutenant in Homicide Exley must prove that he belongs, which pushes him into the brutality and corruption in investigating the Night Owl murders that he condemned in his own father. He has contempt for Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) but learns to appreciate Vincennes' street skills. He regards Bud White (Russell Crowe) as a \"mindless thug\", but ultimately sees White's pure dedication and bravery.

Stompanato was born into an Italian-American family in predominantly Irish-American Woodstock, Illinois. Stompanato was the youngest of four brothers; his brother Carmine, as of 2006, still lived in Indiana and served as a Presbyterian elder. His father John Sr. was a successful barber and dabbler in real estate. The Stompanato family lived in a big clapboard house on Blakely Street with a much envied garden with a florid statuary. John's mother died after his birth and his father remarried a woman named Verna.Accounts differ as to whether Stompanato got into trouble as a child. However, in 1940, after his freshman year at Woodstock High School, his father sent Stompanato to Kemper Military School, a strict boys' school in Boonville, Missouri. He still had discipline problems at Kemper, but graduated at age seventeen. In 1943 Stompanato joined the U.S. Marines. He saw action in the South Pacific theater at Peleliu and Okinawa, then landed with the Marines in China in 1945.Stompanato later claimed that he stayed in China after the war, operating night clubs and going bankrupt in the process. He may have also worked as a minor bureaucrat at a U.S. government office in Tianjin, China. While working for the government he met and married a Turkish woman who was six years his senior, converting to Islam. Soon the couple returned to Woodstock, Illinois, where Stompanato's son, John Stompanato III, was born. Stompanato worked as a bread salesman for a few months before leaving for Hollywood, California where he gained the help of Charles Hubbard after passing through Chicago, Illinois.In Los Angeles, John owned and managed \"The Myrtlewood Gift Shop\" in Westwood, California. He sold inexpensive pieces of crude pottery and wood carvings as fine art. The few shoppers who entered the store were either served by a part-time clerk or ignored altogether. When he started dating Lana Turner he wore a heavy gold-link bracelet on his wrist with \"Lanita\" inscribed inside. Turner's daughter to second husband J. Stephen Crane, Cheryl Crane, described Stompanato in her autobiography, Detour: A Hollywood Story (1988) as having:\"...B-picture good looks... thick set... powerfully built and soft spoken... and talked in short sentences to cover a poor grasp of grammar and spoke in a deep baritone voice. With friends he seldom smiled or laughed out loud but seemed always coiled, holding himself in... had watchful hooded eyes that took in more than he wanted anyone to notice... His wardrobe on a daily basis consisted of roomy, draped slacks, a silver buckled skinny leather belt and lizard shoes.\"However, the reality was that Stompananto was very jealous and possessive of Turner and severely abused her on many occasions. Turner attempted to end their relationship several times, but he always kept her from doing so. During one incident, Stompanato stormed onto a movie set, and pointed a gun at actor Sean Connery, her costar in Another Time, Another Place, only to have Connery take the gun from him, beat him, and force him from the movie set.On April 4, 1958, Johnny Stompanato was stabbed to death at Turner's Beverly Hills, California home. The assailant was Turner's then teenage daughter, Cheryl. The girl claimed that Stompanato was attacking her mother and she had to defend her. The courts agreed, ruling Stompanato's death to be justifiable homicide. After the ruling, Stompanato's family sued Turner for $7 million; gangster Mickey Cohen supposedly paid the family's legal costs. The case was finally settled out of court.There have been endless rumors since 1958 that Turner was the actual killer. Her daughter supposedly took the blame because she was a minor and would face minimal judicial punishment under the circumstances. However, there is insufficient evidence to prove such claims.Johnny Stompanato is interred at Oakland Cemetery in Woodstock, McHenry County, Illinois."],"ImageURL":["http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTUxMjY1ODQ3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjE2NDc3._V1._SX475_SY389_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTM3OTM3OTYxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTAzNTIwNA@@._V1._SX640_SY425_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTM3OTM3OTYxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTAzNTIwNA@@._V1._SX640_SY425_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTAzMTg5NjY0MzheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDQwMzUyMDQ@._V1._SX640_SY424_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjE4NjUxMTI2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTkyNTIwNA@@._V1._SX640_SY959_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTczMjgyOTExMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODkyNTIwNA@@._V1._SX640_SY280_.jpg","null","null","null"],"Name":["Jack Vincennes","Wendell 'Bud' White","Edmund J.

His mother dies in childbirth. Jedi Masters Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi hide the children to prevent the newly declared Galactic Empire and its ruler, Palpatine, using them to gain greater control over the galaxy. Leia would go to Alderaan and grow up a princess, the adopted daughter of Senator Bail Organa, and Luke would be taken to the desert planet of Tatooine to be raised as a moisture farmer by his Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru. Obi-Wan would then go into exile on Tatooine to keep an eye on Luke during his formative years.19 years later, Luke lives a humdrum existence on Tatooine with his aunt and uncle, who have kept his father's true history a secret from him. He makes his first steps toward his destiny when he finds two droids, C-3PO and R2-D2; he meets Obi-Wan, whom he knows as the eccentric hermit \"Ben Kenobi\", for whom a message in R2-D2's memory system is intended. Obi-Wan tells him that his father was a Jedi, killed by Darth Vader. He then presents Luke with his father's lightsaber. Obi-Wan offers to take Luke to Alderaan, but Luke rejects his offer.Luke changes his mind when he discovers his aunt and uncle have been killed by Imperial stormtroopers. They catch a ride with the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca on their ship, the Millennium Falcon, only to find that Alderaan has been destroyed by the Empire's new superweapon, the Death Star.The group sneaks onto the Death Star and rescues a captive Princess Leia; in the process, Obi-Wan sacrifices himself in a duel with Vader. Luke is heartbroken, but finds the strength (with help from Obi-Wan's spirit) to join the Rebel Alliance and destroy the Death Star.Three years later, Luke is a commander in the Rebel Alliance. While on a mission on the ice planet Hoth, he is nearly killed by a Wampa; he escapes with the help of the Force and his lightsaber. In the frozen wasteland, he sees the spirit of Obi-Wan, who tells him to travel to the planet Dagobah and complete his training under Jedi Master Yoda. Han Solo then saves Luke from freezing to death, having rode out into the night to do so.When the Empire discovers the Rebel base on Hoth, Luke leads a snowspeeder squadron to cover the evacuation. Escaping Hoth in his X-wing, he travels to Dagobah, rather than regrouping with the Alliance. There, he meets Yoda and undergoes rigorous Jedi training, increasing his power in the Force.His training is interrupted by a vision of his friends in pain. Against Obi-Wan and Yoda's advice, he travels to Cloud City to save them, only to be lured into a lightsaber duel with Darth Vader. As his mentors warned, Luke proves to be no match for the powerful and experienced Vader. After losing his right hand, he learns the truth: Darth Vader is his father. Vader offers him the chance to turn to the dark side of the Force and rule the galaxy at his father's side. Horrified, Luke chooses to die rather than be corrupted and throws himself into a deep reactor chasm. However, he is sucked into a garbage chute to the underside of Cloud City and left hanging onto a weather vane. Leia, flying away from Cloud City in the Millennium Falcon, senses Luke's peril and turns the ship around to save him. Aboard the medical ship after rejoining the rebel fleet, Luke's missing hand is replaced with a robotic one.Luke, along with Leia, the droids, and Lando Calrissian, save Han Solo from the gangster Jabba the Hutt, who had acquired the carbonite-encased Solo after the events in the Cloud City. Luke offers to negotiate with Jabba, but instead is forced to fight a fearsome monster, the Rancor. When Luke kills it, Jabba sentences him to be thrown into a The Pit of Karcoon, to be eaten by the Sarlacc. Luke escapes with R2's help, saving his friends and destroying Jabba's barge. We also learn Luke has constructed a new green lightsaber.\nDuring the Battle of Endor, Vader confronts Luke in an attempt to turn him to the dark side.During his return trip to Dagobah, Luke learns from the dying Yoda that Vader is indeed his father, and from Obi-Wan's spirit that Leia is his twin sister. Yoda tells Luke that he will not truly be a Jedi until he confronts his father. Luke insists that there is still good left in Vader, and pledges to bring him back from the dark side.Arriving on Endor as part of a Rebel commando squad, Luke surrenders to Vader in an attempt to bring the Dark Lord back to the light side of the Force. He ultimately becomes a prisoner of the Emperor on the second Death Star, in orbit around Endor.The Emperor and Vader attempt to turn Luke to the dark side with promises to save his friends from certain death. When that fails, the Emperor goads Luke to strike him down to save the Rebels, who are losing the Battle of Endor. Luke momentarily lashes out, but Vader blocks his strike, and father and son face each other in a final duel. Luke tries to keep his emotions under control until Vader senses the existence of Luke's sister and threatens to turn her instead. Enraged, Luke attacks with full fury. Vader loses ground as Luke lands blow after blow; Luke eventually forces Vader on his back and severs his father's mechanical right arm. With The Emperor ordering Luke to strike Vader down to take his place, Luke glances at his own bionic hand and realizes with a visceral horror that he's on the verge of suffering his father's fate. Luke regains control, deactivates his lightsaber and emphatically throws it away, passing Yoda's final test and proudly declaring his allegiance to the Jedi.The Emperor uses Force lightning against Luke in retaliation, nearly killing him. In horrible pain, Luke calls out to his father for help. In an act of self-sacrifice, Vader seizes the Emperor and throws him to his death down a reactor shaft. In the process, Vader is mortally wounded. On the deteriorating Death Star, Luke (at his father's request) removes the mask that had encased Anakin Skywalker's face, and looks upon his father's eyes for the first and only time. Anakin dies moments later, assuring his son that there is still good in him after all. Luke escapes with his father's remains. On Endor, in the manner of a Jedi's funeral, Luke burns the last vestiges of his father that had been Darth Vader. During the Rebel Alliance's victory celebrations on Endor, Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan, Yoda, and his father.","Contents [hideshow]\n\n1. A New Hope\n2.  The Empire Strikes Back\n3.  Return of the Jedi\n\nA New Hope\nAt the beginning of A New Hope, Solo and Chewbacca are notorious smugglers. However, during one Kessel Run, the Imperial Navy intercepts and boards their ship, forcing Solo to jettison his cargo to avoid arrest. This results in a large and mounting debt to his former employer, Jabba the Hutt, who places a bounty on Solo's capture. Desperate to pay off his debt to Jabba, Solo accepts a charter to transport Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker, and their two droids to the planet Alderaan. As a result, Solo reluctantly becomes involved in the Rebel Alliance and helps them rescue Princess Leia from Imperial custody, though he claims he is \"only in it for the money,\" and parts ways with the rebels after delivering them to safety and receiving his payment. However, near the end, he has a change of heart, and helps Luke Skywalker destroy the Death Star at the Battle of Yavin. As a result, Solo is handsomely rewarded and given, along with Luke Skywalker, the Alderaanian Medal of Freedom. The Empire Strikes Back\nIn The Empire Strikes Back, set three years later, Solo again attempts to leave the Rebel Alliance as he is still being relentlessly pursued by Jabba's minions. However, he is once again dragged back into action when he saves Skywalker from freezing to death and Princess Leia from an Imperial invasion of the rebel base on Hoth. It is likely that Solo's personal feelings toward the princess played a major role in his decision. He takes her to hide on the planet Bespin, but his old friend Lando Calrissian betrays him and turns them over to Darth Vader, who was informed of their location by Solo's nemesis, bounty hunter Boba Fett. After being tortured by Vader, Solo's body is frozen in carbonite and given to Fett as a reward, who then delivers the incapacitated Solo to Jabba. Return of the Jedi\nSix months later, during the events of Return of the Jedi, Skywalker, now a nearly full-fledged Jedi, rescues Solo from Jabba (with help from Leia, Chewbacca, and a penitent Calrissian). Upon rejoining the rebels, Solo, now promoted to general, accepts their offer to lead the commando raid on an Imperial shield generator facility on the forest moon of Endor. By destroying the shield generator, they allow rebel fighters to enter the Death Star's superstructure and destroy it in the ensuing Battle of Endor, permanently crippling the Empire.","Contents [hideshow]\n\n1. Main Biography\n2. Expanded Biography\n\nMain Biography\nLeia Organa had accomplished much at a young age: a leader in the Alliance to Restore the Republic, a former member of the Imperial Senate, and a member of the Royal Family of Alderaan. Yet despite her stature, for many years, Leia herself was not privy to much of her true heritage.\nIt was common knowledge throughout the court that Leia was adopted into the Royal Family. What wasn't common knowledge was that Leia was born to Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi pupil who succumbed to the dark side and became Darth Vader. She was one of a set of twins, born in secrecy and protected from Vader and the Emperor. The Jedi hero and general, Obi-Wan Kenobi, saw to it that Leia was secretly transported to the planet Alderaan, where she was to be raised by Kenobi's friend Bail Organa. The boy, Luke, was taken to the distant world of Tatooine. Leia has few memories of her true mother, Padm\u00e9 Amidala. All that Leia can recall is that she was beautiful, but sad.Leia followed in her adoptive father's footsteps, and entered politics. She became the youngest senator ever in the Imperial Senate, representing Alderaan. As a senator, Princess Leia ran a number of \"diplomatic aid missions\" that were fronts for Rebel resupply missions. She used her diplomatic immunity and her consular ship to gain access to restricted areas.One such mission saw Leia's ship intercepting vital Imperial plans stolen by Rebel spies. These plans, the complete technical readouts of the Death Star battle station, could be exploited by the Alliance to secure a sizable victory over the Empire. Armed with the Death Star plans, Leia was given a mission by her father to find one of the Republic's greatest heroes and recruit him into the Alliance. En route to the planet Tatooine to find General Obi-Wan Kenobi, Leia's ship was attacked by Imperial forces, and she was taken prisoner by Lord Darth Vader. She barely had time to hide the stolen plans into the memory systems of an R2 unit, and ordered it to find Obi-Wan on Tatooine.As a prisoner of Vader, Leia underwent terrible torture aboard the Death Star. In addition to the mind probes, the Imperials forced her to witness the destruction of her home planet of Alderaan. Despite this, she refused to reveal the location of the hidden Rebel base, or the whereabouts of the stolen plans. Shortly thereafter, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo rescued her from the battle station and carried her and the stolen plans to the Rebel base on Yavin's fourth moon. Due to Leia's efforts, and the help of her companions, the Death Star was eventually destroyed.Three years later, the Alliance had set up a new base on the frozen world of Hoth. Princess Leia was one of the commanding members of Echo Base. When the Imperials attacked Hoth, Leia took the initiative, and acted in a number of command roles, ordering the evacuation of the base. Leia's access to her own escape transport was cut off, but she managed to escape in Han Solo's Millennium Falcon.Evading Imperial pursuit, the Falcon landed in an asteroid field so that its crew could repair the vessel. It was during these quiet moments that Princess Leia Organa fell in love with Han Solo. The two voiced their love on Cloud City of Bespin, where the Imperial forces tracked them. Darth Vader captured Han Solo, and Leia was forced to watch as the Dark Lord froze him in carbonite, and then handed him over to the bounty hunter, Boba Fett. Leia escaped Cloud City with the aid of its administrator, Lando Calrissian.The Rebels eventually tracked down Boba Fett as the bounty hunter delivered Han's carbon-frozen form to Jabba the Hutt. Leia participated in Luke's plan to free the captured Solo from the clutches of the vile gangster. She posed as Boushh, an Ubese bounty hunter and infiltrated the palace, freeing Solo from his carbonite imprisonment. Her identity was revealed, and for a time, she had to endure the humiliation of being made one of Jabba's slaves. She repaid the gangster, however, by strangling the Hutt with the very chain that bound her.Leia rejoined Alliance High Command in time to accompany General Han Solo's strike team on the moon of Endor. Their mission was to destroy the shield generator protecting the second Death Star. While on Endor, Leia became separated from the strike team, and befriended an Ewok tribe. Her diplomatic skills aided in convincing the Ewoks to help the Rebel force. It was shortly thereafter that Luke revealed their true lineage to her. For a time, Luke and Leia kept their true relation and their parentage a secret from all but their most trusted friends.During the ground battle at the Imperial complex, Leia sustained a slight blaster wound. After the victory at Endor, Leia continued to demonstrate some ability in the Force, being able to sense her brother's presence.Leia is a driven, dedicated individual. She has a forceful, some would say abrasive, personality. She is professional in all respects, but occasionally relaxes her guard to let her strong compassion and quirky sense of humor show. Leia is a petite, fair-skinned human female with brown eyes, and long brown hair that she often wears in an elaborate fashion.Expanded Biography\nLeia was raised in a life of privilege, a stark contrast to her twin brother who grew up on the harsh desert world of Tatooine. Despite this, Leia never grew soft or decadent. Her strong personality and bright intellect molded her into an exceptional person, one that Bail Organa loved and was very proud of. She avoided the vagaries of court politics and intrigue, and instead concentrated on bettering herself and helping others.\nLeia had a happy childhood, learning in the best institutes on Alderaan, and studying politics, history and art. Leia's interest in art was one of her main reasons for joining the Rebellion. Learning how the Empire controlled expression really cemented her devotion to the Alliance's cause. Leia learned history from one of the greatest professors in the galaxy, Arn Horada. She was taught self-defense and combat skills from Giles Durane, the Weapons Master.When the galaxy plunged into civil war, Leia's diplomacy and martial skills served the Rebel Alliance. On a diplomatic mission to Ralltiir, a world subjugated by the Empire, she discovered a wounded Rebel with information stored in his brain through hypnotic imprint. This Rebel had the news of the Death Star operation. Learning of the abominable weapon, Leia discovered that there was no redeeming the Empire. What was to some an ordered, structured government built on the ashes of a corrupt and ineffective Republic was to Leia a vile villain to be destroyed. One of her first open acts of Rebellion was simply self-defense -- Leia was attacked by Imperial Lord Tion for her Rebel affiliations, and she was forced to take his life.Fully committed to the Alliance cause, Leia's convictions were by no means swayed by the Alderaan tragedy. She continued to serve the Alliance in diplomatic capacities. En route to a conference on Circarpous IV, Luke and Leia crash-landed on the jungle planet Mimban. There, Leia was forced to face Darth Vader during a quest for the legendary Kaiburr Crystal. Leia held off the Dark Lord single-handedly with Luke's lightsaber before Skywalker was able to defeat him. Vader was merely toying with her, scarring her continuously with his deadly blade. Luke used the Kaiburr's healing power to mend Leia's grievous wounds.Leia attended an important Conference of Uncommitted Worlds on the planet Kabal after the Battle of Yavin. There, she recruited the Aquaris Freeholders to the Alliance. The Freeholders proved very resourceful and valuable when the Alliance abandoned Yavin as their base. During the Alliance relocation, Leia was able to access lost Organa resources of money and capital on Ord Mantell greatly needed for the Rebel war effort. Leia's efforts were also felt in the distant Minos Cluster, where she helped unify Rebellion against the Empire.In the months that followed the Battle of Hoth, Leia felt torn between her duties to the Rebellion and her devotion to Han. Although she and her friends continued their search for Boba Fett, she still had Alliance missions to undertake. In her devoted search for Solo, Leia found herself drawn into the underworld of Black Sun, a vast criminal syndicate that permeated the entire galaxy. There, she was almost seduced by Prince Xizor, the ruler of the organization. His handsome features and irresistible pheromones nearly wooed Leia to his side, but she overcame his temptation.After the Battle of Endor, Leia went on a number of diplomatic missions on behalf of the newly founded Alliance of Free Planets. When the New Republic replaced the interim government, Leia was one of the inner council members that helped shape its growth.Four years into the New Republic's rule, the normally isolationist government of the Hapes Consortium began making entreaties. The Hapan Prince Isolder proposed marriage to Leia, offering the vast wealth of the Hapes Cluster to the Republic in exchange for her hand. Han Solo would have none of it. In a characteristically brash and reckless move, Han kidnapped Leia and stole away to Dathomir, a world he won in an incredible game of sabacc. Though Solo was an expert at marksmanship, piloting and smuggling, his idea of the \"romantic\" could have definitely used some work. Despite eloping to a world full of evil Force-weilding witches and an Imperial garrison, Leia's heart still chose the scruffy-looking scoundrel over the dashing prince, and Han and Leia were married shortly thereafter.Now known as Leia Organa Solo and the New Republic Minister of State, she set out on her most challenging role: that of mother. Leia gave birth to twins, Jacen and Jaina, during one of the New Republic's most trying times. Against a backdrop of war unleashed by Imperial warlord Grand Admiral Thrawn, Leia delivered two healthy and very Force-sensitive babies. A year-and-a-half later, she had a third child, Anakin.When Mon Mothma stepped down from her position of Chief of State of the New Republic due to health issues, she passed on the mantle of leadership to Leia. Organa Solo ruled for several years, guiding the Republic through numerous crises as the government experienced growing pains.Though Leia stepped away from public office, she still remained a valuable member of the New Republic hierarchy. Her relief efforts during theYuuzhan Vong crisis are well known. The mother of full-grown Jedi Knights, Leia still brandishes her lightsaber and Jedi heritage, though she readily admits regret that her political career had interfered with her early Jedi training.Her connection to the Force helped her weather the trying times of the Yuuzhan Vong crisis. Leia struggled to keep her family together during the invasion, becoming the emotional anchor when the tragic death of Chewbacca deeply affected Han. Grief-stricken, Solo withdrew from his commitments as father and husband.Following a near-death experience on Duro, Leia and Han were reunited, and bolstered each other's strength, renewing their commitment and faith in their love. Such strength was vital, for more bloodshed was to scatter the Solo family. Leia's headstrong son, Anakin, died in a heroic mission into Yuuzhan Vong territory. The pain and anguish of that loss echoed through the Force, crippling Leia with despair.Yet she did not lose all hope. Her remaining two children also felt the loss of Anakin. Jacen was held captive by the Yuuzhan Vong, and most in the New Republic believed him dead. But Leia held onto her adamant belief that Jacen was still alive, even though he seemed undetectable through the Force. Jaina plunged herself into her dangerous career as a starfighter pilot, leading foolhardy sorties against the Yuuzhan Vong. The young pilot worked hard to build walls around her emotions, and even excluded her mother from her war-weary heart for a time. The two were eventually able to settle their differences.After months of uncertainty, the remnants of the Solo family were finally reunited as the fragments of the New Republic consolidated its push against the Yuuzhan Vong. While Leia stayed clear of any official involvement in the newly formed Galactic Alliance government, she continued her service as a skilled diplomat, flying missions into territories that had lost contact with the rest of the galaxy during the invasion, and attempting to weave together the fragments torn apart by the Yuuzhan Vong.","Contents [hideshow]\n\n1. Main Biography\n2. Extended Biography\n\nMain Biography\nCardplayer. Scoundrel. You'll like him. That was Han Solo's hurried precis on his old pal, Lando Calrissian. While the description is accurate, it barely scratches the surface of this complicated rogue. Calrissian is at home in the shadowy reaches of the fringe, the underworld culture that permeates the galaxy. While he has rubbed elbows with hunters, mercs, outlaws and gangsters, Lando's main difference is that his elbows were covered by some of the most expensive and fashionable clothes this side of the Core. Lando has style and class; some would say in excess. He is a man of sophisticated tastes, and settles for nothing short of the best in his surroundings, his belongings, his look, and his female companionship.\nHan and Lando go way back, you'll hear them say, but it hasn't always been friendship and camaraderie. Solo and Calrissian have been rivals in the past. A bitter point of contention between the two has been the ownership of the Millennium Falcon. The deceptively dilapidated freighter once belonged to Calrissian, and much to the gambler's chagrin, he lost it to Solo in a heated game of sabacc. Though Solo insists he won fair and square, Calrissian still questions Solo's victory, if only to goad the Corellian.Lando was the first of the two friends to go \"respectable,\" a fate worse than death to some smugglers. He distanced himself from the life on the run, and settled down in the floating metropolis of Cloud City, on the gas planet Bespin. Lando became baron-administrator of the city and its lucrative Tibanna gas mining operation. Where once he had only looked out for himself, Lando now found himself responsible for the lives of millions of Cloud City residents. Despite himself, Lando found that he had a knack for administrative duties, and enjoyed being a businessman and community leader as much as a cardshark.Lando's new world came crashing down around him when the Empire arrived at Cloud City. It was shortly after the Battle of Hoth when the Dark Lord, Darth Vader, and the masked bounty hunter Boba Fett came before him. They had tracked down the Falcon and its crew heading to Cloud City, and forced Calrissian to agree to turn Solo over to the Empire. In exchange, the Empire would not interfere with Cloud City, and allow it to remain an independent colony. Calrissian was torn -- was a friend's life worth more than the lives of his people?Reluctantly, Calrissian agreed to the Empire's plan and lured Solo into a trap. Throughout the ordeal, Vader kept altering his end of the bargain, and Calrissian was powerless to stop him. The gambler learned an important lesson: never deal with a Dark Lord.With all the cards on the table, Lando realized that he was set up to lose. Although Solo was captured, frozen in carbonite, and taken to the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt, Calrissian seized the initiative to redeem himself. He freed Solo's friends, Leia Organa and Chewbacca, and warned Cloud City's populace of the impending Imperial takeover. Calrissian, aboard the Millennium Falcon, led the escape from the city. He even helped rescue a wounded Luke Skywalker before returning the fugitive Rebels to the Alliance fleet.Calrissian volunteered in a daring mission to rescue Solo from Jabba the Hutt's fortress on Tatooine. He concealed himself in the armor of one of Jabba's many faceless skiff guards and infiltrated the palace. Lando was in perfect position when Skywalker sprung his rescue mission over the Great Pit of Carkoon.The skiff guards never knew they had a Rebel in their midst. Calrissian helped dispose of several of the guards protecting the prisoners, and piloted the rescue skiff that spirited away the newly liberated Solo and his friends.During the Battle of Endor, Calrissian again proved his mettle. Now a General in the Alliance Forces, Lando volunteered to spearhead the starfighter attack on the second Death Star while Admiral Ackbar led the capital ships. His past exploits in the Battle of Tanaab helped prepare him for the coming conflict. His unorthodox strategies worked well with Ackbar's more conservative tactics. When the Death Star proved operational, Ackbar was ready to retreat. Instead, Calrissian commanded the Alliance Fleet to engage the Imperial Fleet at point-blank range, offering limited protection from the Death Star's massive superlaser weapon.Once a Rebel strike team deactivated the Death Star's protective deflector shield, Lando led the starfighters into the station's incomplete superstructure. Lando, aboard the Falcon, flew point into the twisting narrow corridors of the Death Star's innards. Once in the massive reactor core, he loosed a volley of concussion missiles at the Death Star's exposed heart. He then outran the fantastic explosion that followed, and the Millennium Falcon emerged triumphantly from the dying Death Star.Extended Biography\nCrime lords, bounty hunters, Imperials, jealous husbands and the last known Sorcerer of Tund -- Lando has outrun them all with a winning combo of skill and luck. It took years of practice to get there -- Lando's first game of sabacc was a disaster when a misunderstanding of the rules led to big losses. Those days are far in the past, a past that Calrissian purposely keeps secretive. After all, a mysterious air is a sure way to attract the ladies.\nEarly in his fringe career, Lando acquired the Millennium Falcon in a game of chance. Embarrassment may have played a role in his accepting the less-than-desired prize, since Lando wasn't one to admit that he was a terrible pilot. He quickly hired a piloting droid to teach him the ropes. He got far more than he bargained for with the acquisition of the chromed starfish-shaped droid curiously named Vuffi Raa.Over the year he spent with Vuffi, Lando's skills grew as did the peril he found himself in. Rokur Gepta, the last known Sorcerer of Tund and ally of the Emperor, shanghaied Lando into a treasure hunting caper that saw the gambler inadvertently resurrect the long lost civilization of the Sharu. Calrissian ran afoul of Gepta again in the Oseon system, and once again in the ThonBoka nebula. In that sack-shaped cloud of dust and gas, Lando helped save an endangered spaceborne species known as the Oswaft from the actions of the Centrality fleet. Lando ended that escapade with enough credits to buy a city.Lando's wealth waxed and waned over the next few years, as he came into possession of such oddities as a used starship lot on Nar Shaddaa. The Falcon ended up here as Lando concentrated on newer vessels, like the stylish Cobra. When Lando lost a sabacc game to Han and forfeited a ship from his lot, he didn't expect the Corellian to choose the shabbiest -- but fastest -- ship, the Millennium Falcon.A short time later, Calrissian helped Han Solo in a strike against the Hutt spice-processing and slaving operations on Ylesia. Solo was romantically tied to a Rebel agent -- Bria Tharen -- who masterminded the assault, and used his fringe connections to recruit a number of smugglers for the mission. When Tharen doublecrossed Solo and kept the spoils of war for the Rebellion, Solo found himself unable to pay the promised rewards to the smugglers. This marked a major falling out between Calrissian and Solo, and the two parted ways never to see each other again for years.Calrissian's life took a major turn when he won the administrator title of Cloud City from its draconian ruler, Baron Raynor. The peculiarities of Cloud City laws were such that citizens of the floating metropolis were forbidden to gamble. Conversely, citizens didn't have to pay taxes -- it was the tourists who gambled and paid taxes. A man of Calrissian's wealth could care less about taxes -- it was the thrill of sabacc he wanted. To circumvent this law, Calrissian took to disguising himself as an old man in order to play in the city's casinos. A responsible administrator (one of the few in Cloud City's history), he made sure to lose all his winnings to the house by night's end.After being pulled into the Rebel fold, Calrissian helped on numerous Alliance missions. He also helped in the search for Han Solo, whose capture he felt very guilty about. Although he failed in stopping Boba Fett on the moon of Gall, he did participate in the rescue of Princess Leia Organa from the tempting clutches of Prince Xizor on Coruscant.Lando next infiltrated Jabba's palace, posing as skiff guard Tamtel Skreej. This put him in excellent position to assist Luke Skywalker when the young Jedi sprang his rescue mission to free Han.Once the Empire was defeated at Endor, Lando returned to civilian life, resigning his commission in the Alliance military. Although he assisted a few Republic military ventures -- such as the short-lived Senate Interplanetary Intelligence Network -- he instead concentrated on business and speculating. Calrissian became the administrator of Hologram Fun World, a mining operation on Nkllon, and a housing project deep in the heart of Coruscant. When the Republic needed him the most, however, Calrissian could be counted on to help. When the resurrected Emperor began his scourge of the Core Worlds, Lando resumed his rank of general and commanded a number of missions deep into enemy territory.Now, two decades after the victory at Endor, Lando has settled down. He is married to Tendra Risant, and ran a mining and processing operation on Destrillion and Dubrillion. Once again war encroached on Lando's quiet civilian life, and he was forced to evacuate his people when the Yuuzhan Vong invaded the planet. Always the businessman, Lando turned the war into a source of profit by founding Tendrando Arms. The company manufactures the Yuuzhan Vong-hunting YVH 1 droids, powerful combat automata that have proven effective against the alien invaders.","C-3PO, also spelled See-Threepio, also called Threepio for short, was a protocol droida droid specifically designed to interact with organics. C-3PO's TranLang III Communicator module combined with his AA-1 VerboBrain allowed him to be fluent in over six million forms of communication. He was also equipped with over thirty secondary functions. C-3PO was generally seen with his counterpart, R2-D2, a small, wheeled R2-series astromech droid. C-3PO's main function as a protocol droid was to assist with etiquette, customs, and translation so that meetings of different cultures ran smoothly. In his time, C-3PO loyally served over forty masters. He hated adventure and space travel, as they often resulted in him coming out on the wrong end of a fight, losing parts, and having them reattached, sometimes incorrectly. Together with R2-D2, C-3PO played a pivotal role in galactic history, however lowly he may have thought of himself.","Contents [hideshow]\n\n1. Main Biography\n2. Additional History\n\nMain Biography\nAn immense, fur covered warrior of great strength and loyalty, Chewbacca the Wookiee was a well-known figure in both the underworld and in the Rebel Alliance. Born on Kashyyyk over two centuries before the Battle of Yavin, Chewbacca was a wise, sophisticated being with exceptional skills in starship piloting and repair.\nChewbacca is a veteran of the Clone Wars, the galaxy-wide conflict that pitted the clone armies of the Republic against the droid forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Wookiee was part of the high command tasked with protecting Kashyyyk from droid invasion. There, he served with fellow Wookiee Tarfful and the Jedi Master Yoda.The wise Yoda had maintained a good relationship with the denizens of Kashyyyk, earning the respect of the mighty Wookiees. When events surrounding the rise of the Empire resulted in the clone forces betraying their Jedi generals, Chewbacca and Tarfful remained loyal to Yoda, helping the Jedi Master escape the clone trap.For their brutish strength and technological savvy, Wookiees were enslaved by the Empire for use as labor. For a time, Chewbacca was a slave, toiling away for the betterment of the Empire until an impudent Imperial cadet named Han Solo freed him.Drummed out of the military, Solo had few options but to return to the fringe lifestyle he knew so well. Chewbacca swore loyalty to Han, and became his partner in crime. The two of them became a well-known smuggling duo. When they came into ownership of the freighter Millennium Falcon, their exploits became legendary.Chewbacca and Solo spent hours modifying and tinkering on their beloved Falcon, souping it up far beyond its original performance specs. Although the Falcon's upkeep was a labor of love, many a time Chewie unleashed his legendary temper on the recalcitrant freighter, banging his massive furry hands against delicate components that refused to behave.Chewbacca became Solo's conscience of sorts. Though the smuggler maintained a mercenary air of bravado that refused to adhere to any ideals other than self-preservation, Chewie was openly the more compassionate of the two. Perhaps it was the ordeal suffered by his people at the hands of the Empire that caused Chewie to feel this way. Although Solo steered clear of any allegiance during the Galactic Civil War, Chewbacca definitely supported the Rebel cause, though the two of them tried to avoid the struggle altogether.Ironically, a simple steerage assignment landed them in the heart of the Rebel Alliance. Desperate for cash, Chewie and Han took on a charter of two passengers and their droids from Tatooine to Alderaan. Little did the two smugglers realize that their cargo consisted of a legendary Jedi Knight, the son of the prophesied Chosen One in Jedi mythology, and a pair of droids containing information vital to both the Empire and the Alliance. This trip inextricably drew Chewbacca and Solo into the Rebel fold, and they continued flying missions for the Rebellion for years after that.Chewbacca stood over two meters tall and had a coat of ginger-brown fur. He wore nothing, save for a bandoleer that held specialized ammunition for the bowcaster that he carried, and a simple tool pouch so that he could enact the many repairs the chronically malfunctioning Falcon required.Additional History\nUnlike most Wookiees who rarely stray from the lush forests of Kashyyyk, Chewbacca's youthful wanderlust took him far from the confines of his green homeworld. His travels first included many remote and dangerous locales on Kashyyyk before taking him to the stars. Chewbacca's heart, however, was firmly rooted on Kashyyyk, and he would always try to make it home for important Wookiee holidays to share with his family.\nFollowing the Clone Wars, the Empire subjugated the planet -- ostensibly to punish the world for harboring Jedi fugitives, but mostly to exploit the Wookiees as slave labor. Chewbacca escaped capture for a time, helping his people as best as he could while living the life of a fugitive.Early on in their smuggling career, Chewbacca stunned Han Solo by returning to Kashyyyk to marry a female Wookiee named Mallatobuck. Solo never pegged Chewie as a family man, but Wookiee customs allowed Chewbacca to continue his flying with Han -- protecting him as the Wookiee life debt demanded -- while still being a husband and, eventually, father. Chewbacca's son, Lumpawarrump, was raised mainly by Malla and Chewie's father, Attichitcuk. Chewie continued to fly the spacelanes, avoiding Imperial patrols and smuggling contraband for various clients, but he returned often to Kashyyyk, to celebrate the Wookiee holiday of Life Day.Wookiees define family differently than most species. To a Wookiee, an \"honor family\" contains the closest of friends, and Chewbacca swore loyalty to all of them, offering protection even at great personal risk. When Han Solo and Leia Organa married and began to raise their own family, Chewbacca took their children into his honor family, and helped guard and raise the three young Solos -- Jacen, Jaina and Anakin.When Chewbacca learned that Solo had been captured by the bloodthirsty Yevetha during the Black Fleet Crisis, he disobeyed Leia's orders and flew straight into the heart of enemy territory: the Koornacht cluster. With the help of his cousins Jowdrrl, Dryanta, and Shoran, and his son, Lumpawarrump, he rescued Han from Yevethan clutches.At the start of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, Han Solo and Chewbacca were on the planet of Sernpidal when it became a target of the alien menace. Using massive gravity-altering creatures called dovin basals, the Yuuzhan Vong began to drag Sernpidal's moon of Dobido from its orbit to the planet's surface. Han Solo, his teenaged son Anakin, and Chewbacca began organizing a desperate evacuation, cramming as many escapees aboard the Falcon as they could.Solo and Chewbacca have had many close calls in the past, and have executed countless last-second escapes; Sernpidal was not to be one of them. As the moon rushed closer to the surface, Chewbacca was cut off from the Falcon. Anakin was faced with a terrible decision. The Falcon could not wait any longer. Rather than endanger everyone aboard, Anakin piloted the ship away, leaving Chewbacca behind. Chewbacca stood his ground, howling defiantly at the immense moon as it crashed into Sernpidal's surface, killing the mighty Wookiee.","Contents [hideshow]\n\n1. As Anakin Skywalker\n2. As Darth Vader\n\nAs Anakin SkywalkerAnakin Skywalker is the central character in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. The original and prequel trilogies follow Anakin's rise as a vessel of The Force, his fall to the dark side, and his ultimate redemption. In the begining Anakin is a Jedi Padawan, and later a Jedi Knight of legend.Anakin first appears as a selfless nine-year-old boy. Anakin and his mother, Shmi, are slaves in the service of Watto, a junk dealer. Anakin can build or repair nearly anything, evidenced by the creation of his own protocol droid, C-3PO, and podracer, each from salvaged parts. He is also a remarkable pilot with quick reflexes.Anakin is found on the planet Tatooine by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, who is convinced that he is the \"Chosen One\" foretold by the Jedi prophecy to bring balance to the Force. Shmi says that he has no father, and that she simply became pregnant with him. Over the course of the narrative, Qui-Gon Jinn goes on to discover that Anakin has the highest known number of midi-chlorians, a measure of Force-aptitude. Anakin forms a strong bond with Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, whom Qui-Gon and his padawan apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, are guarding.After winning Anakin's freedom in a podrace, Qui-Gon brings the boy to Coruscant and requests that the Jedi Council allow him to train Anakin. This request is denied, as the Council thinks that Anakin's future is clouded by the fear he exhibits. Ultimately, Anakin helps win the final battle against the villainous Trade Federation. A dying Qui-Gon, slain by Darth Maul, urges Obi-Wan to train Anakin, and Council leader Yoda reluctantly approves. The Republic's newly-elected Supreme Chancellor, Palpatine, befriends the boy, promising to \"watch his career with great interest.\"10 years later, Anakin, now twenty, is Obi-Wan's padawan. Because his natural abilities place him far above his peers, he has developed into an arrogant loner during his years of Jedi training, and has begun to chafe against Obi-Wan's authority.He is assigned to guard Padm\u00e9, and eventually falls in love with her, even though such emotional attachments are forbidden to Jedi. In conversation with Padm\u00e9, he reveals his affection for her, as well as his distrust of the political process and the need he perceives for there to be one strong leader.While guarding Padm\u00e9, Anakin senses that his mother is in danger. Upon returning to Tatooine, he finds his mother in a village of Tusken Raiders, but arrives too late; she has been tortured and beaten beyond help, and she dies in his arms. Seized by a blind rage, he slaughters the entire village, even the women and children. He returns with his mother's body, and tearfully confesses to Padm\u00e9, who forgives him.Anakin and Padm\u00e9 learn that Obi-Wan has been taken hostage by the droid forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a faction of star systems that want to secede from the Republic. They rush to to the planet Geonosis to rescue him where they are also captured. Faced with their impending demise in a gladiatorial arena, they profess their love to one another. Escaping the fray with the help of a cadre of Jedi and the clone army, Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Yoda engage Separatist leader and fallen Jedi Count Dooku in a lightsaber battle. Obi-Wan is injured in the battle and Anakin is forced to fight him alone. He is easily defeated by the older, more experienced warrior, who severs his lower right arm. Back on Naboo, Anakin's arm is replaced with a mechanical prosthetic, and he marries Padm\u00e9 in a secret ceremony with only C-3PO and his counterpart, R2-D2, to witness.Some years later, Anakin and Obi-Wan return from the Outer Rim to rescue a kidnapped Palpatine. They board the Invisible Hand, flagship of the Separatist fleet and its cyborg leader, General Grievous. Tracking the captive Chancellor to the observation deck, they encounter Count Dooku. A brief battle ensues, in which Dooku renders Obi-Wan unconscious. Once again, Anakin is set to duel with the Count alone. Wanting revenge for his earlier defeat on Geonosis, Anakin overpowers Dooku and neatly sears off both of his hands. Palpatine then commands Anakin to behead the shocked Count. Anakin gives in to his anger and complies, but instantly regrets it, as killing a defenseless prisoner is not the Jedi way.After rescuing the Chancellor, Anakin finds that the flagship is in critical condition, and, with some help from Obi-Wan, barely lands its front half safely on an airstrip.Anakin returns to Coruscant, where Padm\u00e9 tells him she is pregnant. He is initially overjoyed, but that night has a horrible nightmare of Padm\u00e9 dying in childbirth. He is extremely afraid this vision will come true, as it is similar to the one he had of his mother just before she died.Palpatine, who by now has amassed near-dictatorial power in the Senate, makes Anakin his representative on the Jedi Council. The suspicious Council accepts Anakin, but denies him the rank of Jedi Master, and tell him to spy on Palpatine. His pride wounded, Anakin loses all faith in the Council. Ultimately, the Chancellor offers him the chance to learn the dark side, which he claims holds the power to prevent death. Anakin realizes that Palpatine is the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, and reports Palpatine's secret to Jedi Master Mace Windu. He soon follows Windu to the Chancellor's office to make sure Palpatine is taken alive.Anakin arrives to find Windu holding his lightsaber on a disarmed Palpatine. Windu declares the Dark Lord of the Sith under arrest, but Palpatine defiantly unleashes a torrent of Force lightning at Windu. The Jedi Master deflects the lightning with his lightsaber back at Palpatine, hideously scarring his face. The attack continues unabated until Palpatine seemingly tires, giving Windu a chance to strike a deathblow. Anakin pleads with Windu to spare Palpatine's life, but Windu refuses, insisting that Palpatine is too dangerous to be kept alive. As Windu raises his lightsaber to deliver the final blow, Anakin intervenes, severing Windu's right hand. Palpatine then springs to life, bombarding him with Force lightning and hurling him out the window to his death. Anakin then submits to the dark side, and is dubbed Darth Vader. Vader's first task as a Sith Lord is to assault the Jedi Temple and to kill everyone inside, including the children. Vader is then sent to Mustafar to assassinate the Separatist leaders. After completing this task, he is met by Padm\u00e9, who pleads with him to flee Palpatine's grasp with her. He refuses, saying that the two of them can overthrow Palpatine and rule the galaxy together. Obi-Wan, who had hidden himself on Padm\u00e9's ship, suddenly emerges. Vader accuses Padm\u00e9 of conspiring against him, and uses the dark side to choke her into unconsciousness. Kenobi and Vader then engage in an intense lightsaber duel throughout the mining complex. At the end of the duel, Kenobi severs Vader's left arm and both of his legs. As Vader comes into contact with the molten metal, he catches fire and is nearly immolated. Obi-Wan leaves him to die, but Palpatine comes to Vader's rescue.Palpatine reconstructs his apprentice's ruined body with the iconic suit of black armor. Once Vader regains consciousness, Palpatine tells him that Padm\u00e9 had died as a result of Vader's anger. (She had in fact died in childbirth after delivering Luke and Leia.)

Shortly afterward, he duels his former master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, who has arrived at the Death Star to rescue Leia, and cuts him down, turning him into a spirit in the Force. He then encounters Luke Skywalker during a battle over the Death Star, and senses in him a great strength in the Force; this is confirmed moments later when the boy destroys the battle station.

Luke, who has been partially trained by Yoda, duels Vader, but is eventually defeated, losing his right hand to Vader's lightsaber. Vader then reveals his true identity as Luke's father and offers Luke the chance to overthrow Palpatine and rule the galaxy as father and son. Luke refuses, throwing himself down a mine shaft.

The Empire Strikes Back\n1.6. Return of the Jedi\n\nThe Phantom MenacePalpatine represents the small, outer-rim planet Naboo in the Galactic Senate. As Darth Sidious, he arrages for the Trade Federation to invade Naboo, knowing that procedural red tape in the Senate will prevent Supreme Cancellor Valorum from taking any action on the invasion. His plan is to use this failure to act to discredit Valorum in the Senate, and elevate himself to the Chancellorship. Valorum sends two Jedi Knights, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, to Naboo. They end up rescuing Naboo's leader, Queen Amidala, and escorting her to Naboo. Though this was not part of Palpatine's plan, he quickly takes advantage of the situation, manipulating her into calling for Valorum's removal. As expected, being from Naboo himself gains him a sympathy vote, and he is elected Chancellor.During the Battle of Naboo, Palpatine's apprentice, Darth Maul, kills Qui-Gon Jinn but is himself killed by Obi-Wan Kenobi. Palpatine quickly sets his sights, however, on Kenobi's new apprentice: Anakin Skywalker, whom the Jedi believe to be a prophecied Chosen One who will destroy the Sith.Attack of the ClonesTen years later, Anakin Skywalker has grown into a young adult, and Palpatine has maintained a relationship with him for some time. As Chancellor, he is forced to deal with a separatist movement led by former Jedi Count Dooku, who years before had been Qui-Gon Jinn's mentor.Secretly, Count Dooku was in fact Sidious's next apprentice, Darth Tyranus. Sidious planned to use this separatist movement to create a war, and use the war as a pretext to gain more executive power and have his own private army of Clones. The outbreak of the Clone War at the climax of this episode gives Palpatine the power he wants.Revenge of the SithPalpatine arranges for himself to be kidnapped by Count Dooku and General Greivous, laying a trap for Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who come to rescue him. Unbeknownst to all but himself, Palpatine intends to use this incident not only to test Anakin's willingness to use the Dark Side, but also to rid himself of Count Dooku. After Anakin disarms Dooku (literally), Palpatine convinces him to kill Dooku. His willingness to do this proves to Palpatine that he is an ideal Sith apprentice.He spends the next several days grooming Anakin, convincing him that turning to the Dark Side will allow him to save his wife from death in childbirth, and that having a Sith Lord in charge of the galaxy will bring stability. Anakin resists at first, informing the Jedi that Palpatine is a Sith, but later relents, and ends up helping Palpatine kill Mace Windu. In the fight, Palpatine is permanently disfigured. Palpatine accepts Anakin as his apprentice and renames him Darth Vader. He sends Vader to kill all the Separatists, and at the next session of the Senate, declares himself Emperor. Yoda confronts him in the Senate, and the two engage in an epic duel, but it ends in a stalemate, with Yoda going into exhile. Palpatine must then travel to Mustafar to rescue Vader, who has been seriously injured in a duel with Obi-Wan Kenobi. To keep his apprentice alive, Palpatine has him encased on a robotic body and suit.A New HopePalpatine is not seen in this film, but we learn that he has disbanded the Imperial Senate, the last remaining aspect of the Republic's government.The Empire Strikes BackPalpatine appears only in holographic form in this episode. He warns Vader of the threat posed by Luke Skywalker, but Vader suggests turning him to the Dark Side, to which Palpatine agrees.Return of the JediPalpatine finally returns in the flesh in this episode, arriving over Endor to oversee the final stages of the construction of the second Death Star, and to witness the destruction of the alliance. As expected, the Rebel Alliance sends a strike force to Endor to deactivate a shield generator that is protecting the Death Star. When Vader tells him that Luke is with them, he instructs him to bring Luke to him so that they can finish converting him to the Dark Side.Luke is much more resistant to turning than his father was. After being goaded by Palpatine for some time, he finally attempts to kill Palpatine, but Vader comes to his defense, and father and son engage in a lightsaber duel. Luke finally disarms his father, at which point Palpatine urges him to kill his father and become his next apprentice. Unlike his father, Luke refuses, so Palpatine attacks him with Force Lightning, torturing and nearly killing him. Seeing his son nearly dying at his master's hand, however, reawakens the humanity in Vader, and he hurls Palpatine into the Death Star's main reactor. This kills Palpatine, and fulfills the prophecy that he had spent a lifetime trying to prevent. Unfortunately, Palpatine turns his lightning on Vader, shorting out the circuits in his robotic body and mortally wounding him. Vader accepts his fate, however, and asks Luke to remove his mask so he can see his son naturally. He takes one first and last look at Luke, then dies as Anakin Skywalker.","Contents [hideshow]\n\n1.  The Phantom Menace\n2.  Attack of the Clones\n3.  Clone Wars\n4.  Revenge of the Sith\n5.  The Empire Strikes Back\n6.  Return of the Jedi\n\n The Phantom Menace\nIn the timeline of the films, Yoda first appears in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. In that film, Qui-Gon brings the young Anakin Skywalker to the Jedi Council, claiming that the boy is the \"Chosen One\" who will bring balance to the Force, and requests to train him once Obi-Wan has completed the trials necessary to become a Jedi Knight. As told to young Anakin Skywalker, \" Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering..' Yoda plays a key role in that body's initial decision to deny the request; he believes that the boy is clearly affected by his years as a slave, and that he still clings too tightly to the memory of his mother to be trained safely. Yoda thinks his future is clouded.After Qui-Gon's death at the hands of Darth Maul, however, the Jedi Council rescinds their previous decision, despite Yoda's misgivings. Attack of the Clones\nIn Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, set 10 years later, Yoda is a key Republic general at the Battle of Geonosis, when the clone trooper Army of the Republic is first deployed. He leads the group which rescues Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala from execution at the hands of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, aka the Separatists. At the climax of the battle, Yoda duels with Separatist leader and Sith Lord Count Dooku, who was once Yoda's Jedi apprentice. This confrontation ends with Dooku making his escape by threatening Yoda's injured comrades, Anakin and Obi-Wan. Although seemingly frail, the ancient Yoda demonstrates a legendary agility and mastery of lightsaber combat and acrobatics. Clone Wars\nDuring the Clone Wars micro series Yoda is made a General like many of the Jedi Knights and Masters. Yoda escorts Padm\u00e9 on their journey to a planet but Yoda senses several Jedi in distress on Illum and uses the Jedi mind trick to convince Captain Typho to take them there. Yoda saves the two Jedi and finds a message of Dooku giving the orders to destroy the Jedi Temple.As the Clone Wars progress Yoda fights alongside Mace Windu in the Battle of Coruscant and is the one who tries to understand with Master Windu the logic behind the Sepratists massive attack on the Republic Capital. The two Jedi Masters realize that this is a distraction for Grievous to kidnap the Chancellor. Windu goes onto a Clone Hanger to try and prevent the kidnapping. Revenge of the Sith\nIn Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, Yoda leads the Jedi Council in seeking out the mysterious Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Yoda uses his incredible sensitivity and power with the Force to sense the Sith Lord's presence, finally concluding that Sidious is someone within Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's inner circle. Palpatine himself sidetracks the mission, however; by now, the Chancellor has amassed near-absolute power in the Galactic Senate, and begins interfering in Jedi affairs. He appoints Anakin as his personal representative on the Council, which would effectively grant the headstrong young man the rank of Jedi Master. The Council denies Anakin the promotion, however, fearing that giving Palpatine's representative the rank of Master would be the same as giving Palpatine himself a vote in the Council. Embittered by the perceived snub, Anakin begins to lose faith in the Jedi.Earlier, Anakin seeks Yoda's counsel about his intense, prophetic visions that someone close to him will die (he does not tell the Jedi Master that the \"someone\" is Padm\u00e9, now his secret wife and pregnant with his child; emotional attachments are forbidden by the Jedi Code.) Yoda, unaware of the intensity of Anakin's love for Padm\u00e9, tells him to \"Train yourself to let go... of everything you fear to lose.\" Unsatisfied, Anakin instead turns to Palpatine, who reveals himself as none other than Darth Sidious, and manipulates the young Jedi into becoming his Sith apprentice Darth Vader with the promise that, with powers only the dark side can give, he can save his wife.When Palpatine, now self-appointed Emperor of the Galactic Empire, implements Order 66, Yoda is on Kashyyyk, overseeing the battle between the Separatist forces and a combined command of clone troopers and Wookiees. Through the Force, he feels the deaths of each of the Jedi as they are cut down by the very troops they commanded. He swiftly kills the clone troopers sent to dispatch him, escapes with the help of Wookiee leaders Tarfful and Chewbacca, and returns to Coruscant, where he and Obi-Wan fight their way into the Jedi Temple to stop a trap for any Jedi who also survived Order 66. Upon discovering a holographic recording revealing Anakin as the assassin, Yoda sends Obi-Wan to kill his former Padawan. Obi-Wan tells Yoda he cannot fight Anakin, but Yoda insists, saying, \"To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough you are not.\"Subsequently, Yoda battles Palpatine in a titanic struggle that wrecks the Senate building. The fight seems evenly matched between the two patriarchs of both sides of the Force, neither able to overcome the other. Unable to defeat the Sith Lord, Yoda is forced to retreat and go into exile so that he may hide from the Empire and wait for another opportunity to destroy the Sith.Meanwhile, Anakin is defeated by Obi-Wan, losing his limbs and nearly burning to death. The cybernetic enhancements Palpatine administers to save his life render him (seemingly) less than human. His transformation into a fearsome cyborg serves as a grim fulfillment to Yoda's words to Obi-Wan upon learning of Anakin's fall from grace: \"The boy you trained, gone he is, consumed by Darth Vader.\"At the end, it is revealed that Yoda has been in contact with Qui-Gon's spirit. Although this is given little attention in the film, the novelization revealed that Yoda actually becomes Padawan to the deceased Jedi Master's Force ghost, learning the secret of immortality from him and passing it on to Obi-Wan.Yoda is also instrumental in deciding the fate of the Skywalker children after Padm\u00e9 dies in childbirth, recommending that Luke and Leia be hidden from Darth Vader and Palpatine in remote locations. Other than the ancient Jedi Master, only the Organas, the Lars, and Obi-Wan know of their placement. Originally, Obi-Wan wants to have both Yoda and himself take one child each to separate spots and train the children in the ways of the Force, but Yoda realizes that there are other ways to learn discipline than just Jedi training, and that Luke and Leia will need to be trained differently if they are going to defeat the Empire. In addition, the twins' anonymity would be more difficult to protect if the Sith were to discover the remaining Jedi Knights before Luke and\/or Leia were ready. Yoda then retreats to Dagobah. The Empire Strikes Back\nIn Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, set 22 years after Revenge of the Sith, Luke Skywalker arrives on Dagobah to seek Yoda's guidance. This happens after Luke is instructed to do so, by the Force-ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Obi-Wan had sacrificed himself in a duel with Vader in A New Hope).This is Yoda's first appearance, the most beloved and best-remembered of all. Yoda's appearance was based on Freeborn, but Freeborn gave the design eyes based on Albert Einstein's. The puppet was fully operated by Frank Oz, with two technical assistants guiding him on the soundstage.After initial reluctance, Yoda agrees to teach Luke in the ways of the Force. Prior to finishing his training, however, Luke chooses to leave Dagobah in order to confront Darth Vader and save his friends from the Empire's grasp at Bespin. Yoda insists to Luke that he is being lured into a trap, and that he must stay to complete his training. However, Luke cannot forsake his friends who are in danger. He promises to return to complete his training. Return of the Jedi\nYoda's final chronological appearance is in Return of the Jedi, set a year later. Yoda, sick and greatly weakened by old age, informs Luke that he has completed his training but will not be a Jedi until he confronts Darth Vader; he also confirms that Vader is Luke's father, which the Sith Lord had told a shocked Luke in the previous film. Yoda then dies at the age of 900 and becomes \"one with the Force.\" He leaves Luke with the knowledge that \"there is another Skywalker.\" Moments later, Obi-Wan's Force ghost helps Luke come to the realization that the sibling Yoda spoke of is none other than Leia.\nWhen the Emperor tries to kill Luke with Force lightning, Vader redeems himself and once again becomes Anakin Skywalker. By killing his master to save his son, he fulfills the prophecy and brings balance to the Force. Anakin dies in his son's arms as the Death Star crumbles around them. Later that night, Luke sees his father's spirit looking at him with pride and gratitude, in the company of Obi-Wan Kenobi and their once and future master, Yoda.","Contents [hideshow]\n\n1. As Anakin Skywalker\n2. As Darth Vader\n\nAs Anakin SkywalkerAnakin Skywalker is the central character in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. The original and prequel trilogies follow Anakin's rise as a vessel of The Force, his fall to the dark side, and his ultimate redemption. In the begining Anakin is a Jedi Padawan, and later a Jedi Knight of legend.Anakin first appears as a selfless nine-year-old boy. Anakin and his mother, Shmi, are slaves in the service of Watto, a junk dealer. Anakin can build or repair nearly anything, evidenced by the creation of his own protocol droid, C-3PO, and podracer, each from salvaged parts. He is also a remarkable pilot with quick reflexes.Anakin is found on the planet Tatooine by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, who is convinced that he is the \"Chosen One\" foretold by the Jedi prophecy to bring balance to the Force. Shmi says that he has no father, and that she simply became pregnant with him. Over the course of the narrative, Qui-Gon Jinn goes on to discover that Anakin has the highest known number of midi-chlorians, a measure of Force-aptitude. Anakin forms a strong bond with Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, whom Qui-Gon and his padawan apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, are guarding.After winning Anakin's freedom in a podrace, Qui-Gon brings the boy to Coruscant and requests that the Jedi Council allow him to train Anakin. This request is denied, as the Council thinks that Anakin's future is clouded by the fear he exhibits. Ultimately, Anakin helps win the final battle against the villainous Trade Federation. A dying Qui-Gon, slain by Darth Maul, urges Obi-Wan to train Anakin, and Council leader Yoda reluctantly approves. The Republic's newly-elected Supreme Chancellor, Palpatine, befriends the boy, promising to \"watch his career with great interest.\"10 years later, Anakin, now twenty, is Obi-Wan's padawan. Because his natural abilities place him far above his peers, he has developed into an arrogant loner during his years of Jedi training, and has begun to chafe against Obi-Wan's authority.He is assigned to guard Padm\u00e9, and eventually falls in love with her, even though such emotional attachments are forbidden to Jedi. In conversation with Padm\u00e9, he reveals his affection for her, as well as his distrust of the political process and the need he perceives for there to be one strong leader.While guarding Padm\u00e9, Anakin senses that his mother is in danger. Upon returning to Tatooine, he finds his mother in a village of Tusken Raiders, but arrives too late; she has been tortured and beaten beyond help, and she dies in his arms. Seized by a blind rage, he slaughters the entire village, even the women and children. He returns with his mother's body, and tearfully confesses to Padm\u00e9, who forgives him.Anakin and Padm\u00e9 learn that Obi-Wan has been taken hostage by the droid forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a faction of star systems that want to secede from the Republic. They rush to to the planet Geonosis to rescue him where they are also captured. Faced with their impending demise in a gladiatorial arena, they profess their love to one another. Escaping the fray with the help of a cadre of Jedi and the clone army, Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Yoda engage Separatist leader and fallen Jedi Count Dooku in a lightsaber battle. Obi-Wan is injured in the battle and Anakin is forced to fight him alone. He is easily defeated by the older, more experienced warrior, who severs his lower right arm. Back on Naboo, Anakin's arm is replaced with a mechanical prosthetic, and he marries Padm\u00e9 in a secret ceremony with only C-3PO and his counterpart, R2-D2, to witness.Some years later, Anakin and Obi-Wan return from the Outer Rim to rescue a kidnapped Palpatine. They board the Invisible Hand, flagship of the Separatist fleet and its cyborg leader, General Grievous. Tracking the captive Chancellor to the observation deck, they encounter Count Dooku. A brief battle ensues, in which Dooku renders Obi-Wan unconscious. Once again, Anakin is set to duel with the Count alone. Wanting revenge for his earlier defeat on Geonosis, Anakin overpowers Dooku and neatly sears off both of his hands. Palpatine then commands Anakin to behead the shocked Count. Anakin gives in to his anger and complies, but instantly regrets it, as killing a defenseless prisoner is not the Jedi way.After rescuing the Chancellor, Anakin finds that the flagship is in critical condition, and, with some help from Obi-Wan, barely lands its front half safely on an airstrip.Anakin returns to Coruscant, where Padm\u00e9 tells him she is pregnant.

The original and prequel trilogies follow Anakin's rise as a vessel of The Force, his fall to the dark side, and his ultimate redemption. In the begining Anakin is a Jedi Padawan, and later a Jedi Knight of legend.Anakin first appears as a selfless nine-year-old boy. Anakin and his mother, Shmi, are slaves in the service of Watto, a junk dealer. Anakin can build or repair nearly anything, evidenced by the creation of his own protocol droid, C-3PO, and podracer, each from salvaged parts. He is also a remarkable pilot with quick reflexes.Anakin is found on the planet Tatooine by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, who is convinced that he is the \"Chosen One\" foretold by the Jedi prophecy to bring balance to the Force. Shmi says that he has no father, and that she simply became pregnant with him. Over the course of the narrative, Qui-Gon Jinn goes on to discover that Anakin has the highest known number of midi-chlorians, a measure of Force-aptitude. Anakin forms a strong bond with Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, whom Qui-Gon and his padawan apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, are guarding.After winning Anakin's freedom in a podrace, Qui-Gon brings the boy to Coruscant and requests that the Jedi Council allow him to train Anakin. This request is denied, as the Council thinks that Anakin's future is clouded by the fear he exhibits. Ultimately, Anakin helps win the final battle against the villainous Trade Federation. A dying Qui-Gon, slain by Darth Maul, urges Obi-Wan to train Anakin, and Council leader Yoda reluctantly approves. The Republic's newly-elected Supreme Chancellor, Palpatine, befriends the boy, promising to \"watch his career with great interest.\"10 years later, Anakin, now twenty, is Obi-Wan's padawan. Because his natural abilities place him far above his peers, he has developed into an arrogant loner during his years of Jedi training, and has begun to chafe against Obi-Wan's authority.He is assigned to guard Padm\u00e9, and eventually falls in love with her, even though such emotional attachments are forbidden to Jedi. In conversation with Padm\u00e9, he reveals his affection for her, as well as his distrust of the political process and the need he perceives for there to be one strong leader.While guarding Padm\u00e9, Anakin senses that his mother is in danger. Upon returning to Tatooine, he finds his mother in a village of Tusken Raiders, but arrives too late; she has been tortured and beaten beyond help, and she dies in his arms. Seized by a blind rage, he slaughters the entire village, even the women and children. He returns with his mother's body, and tearfully confesses to Padm\u00e9, who forgives him.Anakin and Padm\u00e9 learn that Obi-Wan has been taken hostage by the droid forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a faction of star systems that want to secede from the Republic. They rush to to the planet Geonosis to rescue him where they are also captured. Faced with their impending demise in a gladiatorial arena, they profess their love to one another. Escaping the fray with the help of a cadre of Jedi and the clone army, Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Yoda engage Separatist leader and fallen Jedi Count Dooku in a lightsaber battle. Obi-Wan is injured in the battle and Anakin is forced to fight him alone. He is easily defeated by the older, more experienced warrior, who severs his lower right arm. Back on Naboo, Anakin's arm is replaced with a mechanical prosthetic, and he marries Padm\u00e9 in a secret ceremony with only C-3PO and his counterpart, R2-D2, to witness.Some years later, Anakin and Obi-Wan return from the Outer Rim to rescue a kidnapped Palpatine. They board the Invisible Hand, flagship of the Separatist fleet and its cyborg leader, General Grievous. Tracking the captive Chancellor to the observation deck, they encounter Count Dooku. A brief battle ensues, in which Dooku renders Obi-Wan unconscious. Once again, Anakin is set to duel with the Count alone. Wanting revenge for his earlier defeat on Geonosis, Anakin overpowers Dooku and neatly sears off both of his hands. Palpatine then commands Anakin to behead the shocked Count. Anakin gives in to his anger and complies, but instantly regrets it, as killing a defenseless prisoner is not the Jedi way.After rescuing the Chancellor, Anakin finds that the flagship is in critical condition, and, with some help from Obi-Wan, barely lands its front half safely on an airstrip.Anakin returns to Coruscant, where Padm\u00e9 tells him she is pregnant. He is initially overjoyed, but that night has a horrible nightmare of Padm\u00e9 dying in childbirth. He is extremely afraid this vision will come true, as it is similar to the one he had of his mother just before she died.Palpatine, who by now has amassed near-dictatorial power in the Senate, makes Anakin his representative on the Jedi Council. The suspicious Council accepts Anakin, but denies him the rank of Jedi Master, and tell him to spy on Palpatine. His pride wounded, Anakin loses all faith in the Council. Ultimately, the Chancellor offers him the chance to learn the dark side, which he claims holds the power to prevent death. Anakin realizes that Palpatine is the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, and reports Palpatine's secret to Jedi Master Mace Windu. He soon follows Windu to the Chancellor's office to make sure Palpatine is taken alive.Anakin arrives to find Windu holding his lightsaber on a disarmed Palpatine. Windu declares the Dark Lord of the Sith under arrest, but Palpatine defiantly unleashes a torrent of Force lightning at Windu. The Jedi Master deflects the lightning with his lightsaber back at Palpatine, hideously scarring his face. The attack continues unabated until Palpatine seemingly tires, giving Windu a chance to strike a deathblow. Anakin pleads with Windu to spare Palpatine's life, but Windu refuses, insisting that Palpatine is too dangerous to be kept alive. As Windu raises his lightsaber to deliver the final blow, Anakin intervenes, severing Windu's right hand. Palpatine then springs to life, bombarding him with Force lightning and hurling him out the window to his death. Anakin then submits to the dark side, and is dubbed Darth Vader. Vader's first task as a Sith Lord is to assault the Jedi Temple and to kill everyone inside, including the children. Vader is then sent to Mustafar to assassinate the Separatist leaders. After completing this task, he is met by Padm\u00e9, who pleads with him to flee Palpatine's grasp with her. He refuses, saying that the two of them can overthrow Palpatine and rule the galaxy together. Obi-Wan, who had hidden himself on Padm\u00e9's ship, suddenly emerges. Vader accuses Padm\u00e9 of conspiring against him, and uses the dark side to choke her into unconsciousness. Kenobi and Vader then engage in an intense lightsaber duel throughout the mining complex. At the end of the duel, Kenobi severs Vader's left arm and both of his legs. As Vader comes into contact with the molten metal, he catches fire and is nearly immolated. Obi-Wan leaves him to die, but Palpatine comes to Vader's rescue.Palpatine reconstructs his apprentice's ruined body with the iconic suit of black armor. Once Vader regains consciousness, Palpatine tells him that Padm\u00e9 had died as a result of Vader's anger. (She had in fact died in childbirth after delivering Luke and Leia.) This half-truth breaks what remains of Anakin's spirit, and he screams in torment. He is last seen overseeing the construction of the first Death Star at Palpatine's sideAs Darth VaderIn Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope and Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, Vader is depicted as the cunning, brutal enforcer of the Galactic Empire's rule across the galaxy. Vader serves as the apprentice of Emperor Palpatine, using the dark side of the Force to mercilessly pursue the Jedi and the Rebel Alliance to the ends of the galaxy. The prequel trilogy recounts the heroic rise and tragic fall of Vader's former self, Anakin Skywalker.Darth Vader is the primary antagonist: a dark, ruthless figure, out to capture, torture, or kill the films' heroes to prevent them from thwarting the Empire.In A New Hope, Vader is charged with recovering the stolen plans of the Death Star and finding the Rebel Alliance's secret base. He captures and tortures Princess Leia and, along with Death Star commander Grand Moff Tarkin, destroys her home world of Alderaan. Shortly afterward, he duels his former master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, who has arrived at the Death Star to rescue Leia, and cuts him down, turning him into a spirit in the Force. He then encounters Luke Skywalker during a battle over the Death Star, and senses in him a great strength in the Force; this is confirmed moments later when the boy destroys the battle station. He was about to shoot Luke down using his TIE fighter, but Han Solo disables his ship using the guns on the Millennium Falcon, and sends Vader spinning into space.In The Empire Strikes Back, Vader captures Leia, Han, Chewbacca, and C-3PO on the planet Bespin to lure Luke into a confrontation. He strikes a deal with the administrator of Cloud City, Lando Calrissian to give Han over to the bounty hunter Boba Fett, and has Solo frozen in carbonite. Luke, who has been partially trained by Yoda, duels Vader, but is eventually defeated, losing his right hand to Vader's lightsaber. Vader then reveals his true identity as Luke's father and offers Luke the chance to overthrow Palpatine and rule the galaxy as father and son. Luke refuses, throwing himself down a mine shaft. He is sucked into a garbage chute and rescued by Leia, Chewbacca, Lando and C-3PO. He is fitted with a robotic hand to replace the one Vader had cut off.In Return of the Jedi, Vader is charged with overseeing the completion of the second Death Star. He meets with Palpatine on board the half-constructed station to plan Luke's turn to the dark side.\nDarth Vader escorting Luke Skywalker to Palpatine in an attempt to turn him to the dark sideBy this time, Luke has nearly completed his Jedi training, and has learned from a dying Yoda that Vader is indeed his father. He learns about his father's past from Obi-Wan's spirit, and also learns that Leia is his sister. On a mission to the forest moon of Endor, he surrenders to Imperial troops and is brought to Vader. Aboard the Death Star, Luke resists the Emperor's appeals to his anger and fear for his friends, but snaps when Vader telepathically probes his mind, learns of Leia's existence, and threatens to turn her instead. Enraged, Luke nearly kills Vader, severing his father's right hand. He controls his anger at the last minute, however, as he looks at Vader's cybernetic hand and then at his own; he realizes that he is perilously close to suffering his father's fate.As the Emperor approaches, encouraging Luke to kill Vader and take his place, Luke throws down his lightsaber, refusing to perform the killing blow. Angered, the Emperor attacks Luke with Force lightning. Luke writhes in agony under the Emperor's torture, begging his father for help. Unable to bear the sight of his son in pain, Vader turns on his master and throws him into the very core of the Death Star, where the evil emperor explodes in a fury of dark energies. However, Vader is mortally wounded by the Force lightning.Anakin Skywalker in his last few moments of lifeMoments from death, he begs his son to take off his breath-mask so he can look at Luke \"with his own eyes\". Luke complies and for the first (and as it turns out, the only) time, father and son truly see each other. In his dying breaths, Anakin Skywalker is redeemed, finally admitting to Luke that the good within him was not destroyed after all. Luke escapes with his father's body as the Death Star explodes, destroyed by the Rebel Alliance.That night, Luke cremates his father in his armor in the manner of a Jedi's funeral. During the victory celebration on the forest moon of Endor, Luke sees the redeemed spirit of Anakin Skywalker, standing once again with Obi-Wan and Yoda.","Obi-Wan Kenobi is a Jedi Knight, and a major character in the Star Wars saga. He is one of only four characters; the others being Anakin Skywaker, C-3PO and R2-D2; who appears in all six films. Obi-Wan acts as a mentor to Anakin Skywalker and his son Luke Skywalker.\n\n\nContents [hideshow]\n\n1.  Prequel trilogy\n1.1.  The Phantom Menace\n1.2.  Attack of the Clones\n1.3.  Revenge of the Sith\n2.  Original trilogy\n2.1.  A New Hope\n2.2.  The Empire Strikes Back\n2.3.  Return of the Jedi\n\n Prequel trilogy\n The Phantom Menace\nIn The Phantom Menace, 25-year-old Obi-Wan accompanies Qui-Gon on a mission to Naboo, a planet ruled by Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala. After making an unscheduled landing on Tatooine, his master stumbles upon Anakin Skywalker, a young slave who shows tremendous potential with the Force. Believing the boy to be the prophesied \"Chosen One\" who would bring balance to the Force by destroying the Sith, Qui-Gon asks the Jedi Council that the boy to be trained as a Jedi. Obi-Wan is also amazed by Anakin's unprecedented midi-chlorian count and strong Force potential, but initially thinks he should not be trained, believing the boy is already too old and has too many emotional attachments to become a Jedi. The Jedi Council agrees, and forbids training for Anakin, in whom they see a great deal of fear and anger.During the film's climactic battle scene, Queen Amidala and her entourage of guards split up from her Jedi bodyguards when the Sith Lord Darth Maul arrives to eliminate the Queen. Wielding a double-bladed lightsaber, Maul simultaneously battles both Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. After being separated from the duel via laser walls, Obi-Wan watches in horror as Maul impales his master. Obi-Wan engages Maul in a fierce duel, cutting Maul's lightsaber in half, but the Sith Lord knocks Obi-Wan into a reactor chasm and kicks his lightsaber into the depths below. Obi-Wan grabs onto an extending pole, breaking his fall. He then calms himself and reconnects with the Force, utilizing it to hurl himself into the air and simultaneously bring his master's lightsaber into his hand, startling Maul and giving him just enough time to slash the Sith Lord in half. The dying Qui-Gon tells Obi-Wan to train Anakin to be a Jedi, and Obi-Wan promises that he will.For his heroics in defeating a Sith (making him the first Jedi in 1,000 years to do so), Yoda personally bestows the rank of Jedi Knight upon Obi-Wan, who then says that he would take it upon himself to train Anakin whether the Council allowed him to or not. Yoda reluctantly agrees, but warns Obi-Wan to be careful with the troubled boy. Attack of the Clones\nIn Attack of the Clones, set 10 years later, Obi-Wan has become an experienced Jedi Knight. By this time, his relationship with his padawan is strained; Anakin has grown powerful but arrogant, and believes that his Master is trying to hold him back.He and Anakin are tasked with protecting Padm\u00e9, now a Senator, after an attempt is made on her life. Obi-Wan tracks the mysterious assassin to the planet Kamino, and learns about a massive clone army that the planet's inhabitants are building for the Galactic Republic. He then meets with the bounty hunter Jango Fett, the template for the clones, and figures out that he is the one responsible for the assassination attempts on Padm\u00e9. Obi-Wan attempts to apprehend Fett, who escapes to Geonosis with his unaltered clone Boba. Obi-Wan follows them by placing a homing beacon on Fett's ship, Slave I.On Geonosis, Obi-Wan learns of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, also known as the Separatists, a conspiracy of star systems that wants to secede from the Republic. The renegades are led by rogue Jedi Count Dooku, who was once Qui-Gon's master. Obi-Wan is captured shortly after sending a message to Anakin. While in captivity, Dooku reveals that the Galactic Senate is under the control of a Sith Lord called Darth Sidious.Later, Anakin and Padm\u00e9 arrive on Geonosis to rescue Obi-Wan. They are themselves captured, however, and all three are sentenced to death by the Geonosians. The executions are prevented by the timely arrival of Jedi and clone reinforcements, led by Jedi Masters Mace Windu and Yoda. Obi-Wan and Anakin confront Dooku and engage him in a lightsaber duel. Dooku strikes Anakin with Force lightning, then turns the deadly barrage onto Obi-Wan, who easily blocks the attack with his lightsaber. The two duel and Dooku outmaneuvers Obi-Wan, striking him on both his left arm and leg. Dooku is about to deliver a killing blow when Anakin recovers from the lightning and blocks Dooku's attack. Dooku and Anakin fight a short duel, and Dooku cuts off Anakin's right arm (which is later replaced by a robotic prosthetic). Yoda arrives and fights Dooku as well, but the Sith escapes; he creates a distraction by nearly killing Obi-Wan and Anakin. Revenge of the Sith\nIn Revenge of the Sith, set three years later, Obi-Wan and Anakin board the Separatist leader General Grievous' flagship, the Invisible Hand, and fight their way to the captive Chancellor Palpatine. There, they find Dooku, who engages them both in a duel. During the duel, Obi-Wan is rendered unconscious, leaving Anakin to face Dooku alone. Anakin defeats Dooku and, at Palpatine's urging, executes the defenseless Count, in violation of the Jedi Code.When Palpatine appoints Anakin to the Jedi Council as his representative, the Council disapproves, considering Anakin too young and headstrong, and reasons that his membership gives the Chancellor a vote in Jedi affairs. Anakin protests when the Jedi Council denies him the rank of Master and orders him to spy on Palpatine, but Obi-Wan talks him into accepting it, warning Anakin of his \"dangerous\" friendship with the Chancellor.Obi-Wan is called away to Utapau to confront General Grievous. This leaves Palpatine, who is secretly Darth Sidious, free to continue corrupting Anakin. The Sith Lord eventually manipulates the young Jedi into embracing the dark side as the Sith Lord Darth Vader.Obi-Wan engages Grievous in combat and shoots and kills him with a blaster. Moments later, however, Obi-Wan's own clone forces turn on him; Unbeknown to Obi-Wan, Palpatine had issued Order 66, directing clone troopers to turn on their Jedi generals. Obi-Wan survives the attempt on his life and escapes by stealing Grievous' star fighter and rendezvousing with Senator Bail Organa and Yoda aboard Bail's ship, the Tantive IV.Along with Yoda and Bail, Obi-Wan returns to Coruscant, where he and Yoda discover that every Jedi in the Jedi Temple has been murdered, even the younglings. They kill the clones remaining at the Temple, and discover that the clones were led there by Anakin. Obi-Wan reprogrammes a beacon, which had been instructing all remaining Jedi to return to the Jedi Temple (where they surely would be killed), by instructing them to scatter across the galaxy and remain in hiding. Subsequently, Obi-Wan and Yoda split up to confront the two Sith Lords, Darth Vader and Darth Sidious. Obi-Wan wishes to fight Sidious, hating the thought of having to kill his friend and pupil. Yoda, however, insists that Obi-Wan telling him \"to fight this Lord Sidious strong enough you are not\", and that he will have to accept that Anakin had been \"consumed by Darth Vader.\"Unaware of his former Padawan's location, Obi-Wan goes to visit Padm\u00e9, who secretly married Anakin and is now pregnant with his child. He tells her what Anakin has done, and reveals that he knows about their marriage. A horrified Padm\u00e9 refuses to accept what Obi-Wan tells her, but is brave enough to go out and confront Anakin herself. Obi-Wan stows away in her ship.Obi-Wan finds Vader at the volcanic planet Mustafar, and attempts to reason with his former student to pull him away from the dark side. When he emerges from Padm\u00e9's ship, however, Vader immediately suspects that Padm\u00e9 has betrayed him, and uses the dark side to force choke her into unconsciousness. Obi-Wan has no choice but to engage him in a long and epic duel, which ranges through the Mustafar mining complex, the lava rivers, and finally the black sand. Obi-Wan tries to persuade Vader to relent, but Vader ignores his warnings and leaps forward to deliver the killing blow. Obi-Wan sees an opening and severs Vader's legs and remaining arm with one stroke. Obi-Wan refuses to finish him off however, and leaves him burning on the volcanic slopes, taking Anakin's lightsaber with him. Vader then slides too close to the lava and nearly burns to death. He survives long enough to be rescued by Palpatine, and is later placed in the iconic black body armor first seen in \"Revenge of the Sith\" and the rest of the original triology.Obi-Wan assists in hiding Anakin's children after Padm\u00e9 dies in childbirth. Luke is put on Tatooine with Owen Lars, so that Obi-Wan can look after him in secret, while his twin sister Leia is put on Alderaan in Bail's care. Yoda then tells Obi-Wan that he has more training for him: the spirit of Qui-Gon would teach him how to retain his identity through the Force and commune with the living after death. Original trilogy A New Hope\nIn A New Hope, Obi-Wan is known to the inhabitants of Tatooine as Ben Kenobi, an eccentric hermit who lives in the Jundland Wastes (he had assumed this identity to hide from the Empire). He's first seen rescuing Luke Skywalker from Tusken Raiders while the boy looks for R2-D2. Obi-Wan presents Luke with Anakin's lightsaber, but when Luke asks Obi-Wan about his father, Obi-Wan disguises the truth from him, saying, \"a young Jedi named Darth Vader... betrayed and murdered your father.\" (Obi-Wan reasoned in Return of the Jedi that Anakin Skywalker died the moment he betrayed the Jedi, completely becoming Darth Vader). R2-D2 then plays the message from Princess Leia Organa asking for Obi-Wan's help in delivering the schematics of the Death Star to her foster father on Alderaan. Obi-Wan invites Luke accompany him to Alderaan and aid the Rebellion against the Empire, but Luke initially refuses. However, when Luke discovers that Imperial troopers hunting down the stolen Death Star plans have killed his uncle and aunt and destroyed their home, he changes his mind. Obi-Wan takes young Luke under his wing in order to teach him the ways of the Force with the intention of fully training the boy later on Alderaan.Obi-Wan and Luke buy passage to Alderaan on the Millennium Falcon, a freight ship owned by smuggler Han Solo and co-piloted by Chewbacca, a Wookiee. Before they can reach their destination, however, Alderaan is destroyed by the Death Star on the orders of Grand Moff Tarkin. The Millennium Falcon is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam. By a quirk of fate, Princess Leia is on board, and her rescue is gallantly executed by Han and Luke. Obi-Wan, meanwhile, sets off to disable the tractor beam so that the Falcon can escape. Obi-Wan is aware of Vader's presence, and knows he isn't coming back. He deactivates the tractor beam and confronts Vader in a lightsaber duel. At the climactic moment in the duel, after telling Vader \"if you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine,\" and just as Luke and the others are making a run for the Falcon, Obi-Wan allows Vader to strike him down, and his body vanishes as becomes one with the Force. In the ensuing confusion, Luke hears Obi-Wan's voice instructing him to \"run, Luke, run!\" and the group makes their escape aboard the Falcon.During the film's climactic battle, Obi-Wan continues to communicate with Luke through the Force, giving him guidance and counsel as Luke destroys the Death Star. The Empire Strikes Back\nIn The Empire Strikes Back, set three years later, Luke is knocked out on the plains of Hoth, and Obi-Wan's force ghost appears telling Luke to go to the Dagobah system for further training with Yoda. After Luke has been trained as a Jedi, Obi-Wan appears in Dagobah to try and dissuade him from going to Cloud City, where Vader holds Han and Leia hostage, as he feels his young apprentice is not yet ready to face Vader one-on-one. After Luke insists on facing Vader, Obi-Wan says sadly that he couldn't help him.Luke is nearly killed in a lightsaber duel with Vader, who reveals to him that he is his father and tries to enlist him into the dark side of the Force. Luke escapes, but is haunted by the truth Obi-Wan withheld from him. Return of the Jedi\nIn Return of the Jedi, set one year later, a dying Yoda confirms to Luke that Vader is indeed his father. After Yoda's death, Obi-Wan appears on Dagobah as a Force Ghost to explain to a heartbroken Luke why he did not tell him the truth about his father, and to confess that Leia was his sister. Obi-Wan admits that his own pride had been partly to blame for Anakin Skywalker's fall from grace: \"I thought I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong.\" He then tries to explain to Luke that killing Vader is the only way to destroy the Empire and save the galaxy, even if it means committing patricide.At the end of the film, Obi-Wan's ghost appears alongside the ghosts of fellow Jedi Yoda and a redeemed Anakin on the forest moon of Endor, watching over Luke and his comrades as they celebrate the destruction of the second Death Star and, with it, the Empire.","R2-D2, phonetically spelled Artoo-Detoo or Artoo, was an astromech droid and undoubtedly the most famous unit of the R2 series. A longtime friend and counterpart of the protocol droid C-3PO, he served the Skywalker family faithfully for many years. Along with his resourcefulness, R2-D2 was equipped by his original owners, the Royal House of Naboo and the Royal Naboo Starfighter Corps, with many tool-tipped appendages that allowed him to serve as a superior starship mechanic and computer interface specialist. A bold droid in personality and temperament, R2-D2 would often enter dangerous situations without second thought in order to give aid to his masters. This adventurous streak served his companions well on numerous occasions, often turning the tide of galactic history.R2-D2 was a diminutive droid, standing 0.96 meters tall. He rolled on three legs, one could retract into his body, and had a silver and blue domed head. His white, blue, and silver body housed many arms, sensors, and other apparatuses, many of which were not readily seen by the typical humanoid eye. This often made the droid seem like a box of tricks, unexpectedly pulling out some previously unseen but much needed device at a critical moment.While R2-D2 contained many specialized gadgets, he was also quite good at taking the initiative and often employed unorthodox means to help his friends.","Paploo was an Ewok from the forest moon of Endor. He was the son of Warok and Bozzie, the nephew of Chief Chirpa, and a close friend of Wicket W. Warrick. He had cinnamon-colored fur and wore a smooth stone in the center of his hood. He was a boisterous, sometimes foolhardy, Ewok, especially in his youth.","Tiaan Jerjerrod (pronounced \/d\u00e6rd\u00e6rrd\/) was a Human male Imperial officer who worked as a desk general in Logistics and Supply before becoming Moff of the Quanta sector by 1 ABY. His sector operations were based in a family estate in Val Denn, the capital city of Tinnel IV. In 3 ABY, he was present aboard the Star Dreadnought Executor during the occupation of Bespin and greeted Darth Vader when he returned to the warship. A year later, Jerjerrod had been assigned to oversee the construction of the second Death Star above the forest moon of Endor, appointed to that position by Emperor Palpatine himself. To hide the existence of the new Death Star, records claimed Jerjerrod had been made Director of Imperial Energy Systems and assigned to oversee the construction of large-scale power generators.Whereas the first Death Star had taken around nineteen years to complete, the construction of the much-larger second Death Star had moved into its final stage of assembly after approximately two to four years. However, the construction crews had fallen behind schedule; Vader ventured to the battlestation to inform Jerjerrod that the issue needed to be rectified. Vader announced that the Emperor would be arriving to personally oversee the last stage of the Death Star's construction. Jerjerrod informed Vader that his men would double their efforts, as he was afraid of reporting his failure directly to the Emperor. Jerjerrod was among those assembled to greet Palpatine when he arrived.The Rebel Alliance had learned of the second Death Star's construction and the Emperor's presence aboard it via the Bothan Spynet, and they launched an attack based on false information released by the Emperor himself. When the Alliance Fleet arrived, they discovered that the planetary shield protecting the Death Star was still activated and that the Imperial Navy was situated to prevent the Rebels from escaping. Palpatine had ordered Admiral Firmus Piett not to directly engage the Rebel capital ships, a move that confused personnel on both sides. The reason behind this became clear when the Emperor ordered Jerjerrod to fire the Death Star's operational superlaser at the Alliance Fleet; many Rebel capital ships were obliterated. When the Alliance gained the upper hand in the conflict, Palpatine commanded the Moff to fire on the forest moon.

The nobility had turned to Edward I of England to mediate the disputes. After securing acknowledgments of Edward's overlordship from most of the contestants, he named John Balliol as the new king, but imposed humiliating and often burdensome authority over Balliol and Scotland. The final straw came when Edward demanded that Scotland provide military aid for his war against France.The Scots refused, and struck a peace treaty with the French. In the mid to late 1290s, William Wallace emerged as a charismatic figure, drawing an army to himself. Along with Andrew Moray, Wallace utterly crushed an English army at the Battle of Sterling Bridge (1297), but was subsequently defeated by an army led by King Edward himself at the Battle of Falkirk (1298). Although Wallace survived and escaped the battle, he was betrayed and captured some years later, in 1305. He was sent to London, where he was convicted of treason, and publicly executed.","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","Edward I of England (1239-1307) was king of England from 1272 until his death in 1307.Although he initially sided with the barons in their reform movement, he soon abandoned this stance and realigned with his father, Henry III (1207-1272), and fought on his behalf in the Second Barons' War (1264-1267). After England had been pacified, Edward embarked on the Ninth Crusade (1271-2), which ended in failure. On his return home, he was informed that his father had died, and that he was now king of England.After spending the early years of his reign focused on legal reforms, his attentions turned toward military matters. In 1282-3, he launched a full-scale war of conquest in Wales, after which he built numerous castles and towns in Wales which he populated with Englishmen.He next turned his attention toward Scotland. Scotland and England had coexisted relatively harmoniously in the 13th century. Unfortunately, in the 1280s all three of King Alexander III's children died in quick succession just before Alexander himself in 1286. This left only Alexander's granddaughter: Margaret, Maid of Norway (her father was King Erik II of Norway). Margaret was far from an ideal heir. Not only was she out of the country (in Norway; she had never even been to Scotland), but more importantly, she was only three-years-old at the time. Competition for control of the kingdom quickly sprouted between the houses of Balliol and Bruce. In an attempt to put these claims to rest, the Treaty of Birgham was drawn up in 1289, which designated that Margaret would marry Edward's son, the future Edward II (1284-1327). Although the treaty made overtures that Scotland would remain independent, English scribes put in enough clauses to negate Scottish claims of independence. The matter was further complicated when Margaret died while en rout to Scotland. Fourteen claimants vied for the crown, primarily John Balliol and Robert Bruce. Edward was asked to adjudicate in the dispute, and eventually ruled in favor of John Balliol. However, Edward exerted dominion over Baliol. The final straw came when Edward demanded that Scotland provide military assistance against France. The Scots refused in 1295, made a peace treaty with France, and rebelled against England. The rebellion failed and was swiftly crushed by Edward, who then installed Englishmen to run Scotland.The constant warfare of Edwards reign put a tremendous financial strain on the royal treasury. Edwards solution to this was to attack the source of loans: Englands Jewish population. In 1290, he issued the Edict of Expulsion, forcing all Jews to leave the kingdom, and denying them the right to take their possessions with them. With this move, Edward was able to not only eliminate his own debts, but also seize the wealth of all of the wealthy lenders in the kingdom.Although the situation in Scotland seemed resolved in 1295, rebellion soon flared up again in 1297 around the figure of William Wallace. Through a combination of good planning and patience on Wallaces behalf, and poor judgment on behalf of Cressingham Warrenne (commanders of the English army), the Scottish army managed to thoroughly route the English at the Battle of Stirling Bridge in September of that year.The Scottish victory shocked England, and Edward himself rode out to face Wallace (this would be the first major battle in which Edward had personally participated since 1265). In July of 1298, the two forces met at the Battle of Falkirk. Although the Scots are said to have fought fiercely and inflicted heavy casualties on the English, the day ended in an English victory. Edward continued the campaign in Scotland, but after Falkirk, the Scots avoided open battle, preferring instead to conduct smaller raiding attacks into northern England.Wallace was betrayed and captured in 1305 and publicly executed in London. Edwards success appeared nearly complete, but in 1306, Robert Bruce murdered his rival John Comyn and had himself crowned King of Scotland. Edward, now in ill health, entrusted the suppression of this new threat to his son and two of his lords. The English met with early success, routing the Bruce at the Battle of Methven in June. However, the tide soon turned with the victory going to the Bruce at the Battle of Loudoun Hill in 1307.Edward traveled north in an attempt to confront this problem personally, but old age and ill health got the best of him. He contracted dysentery died just south the Scottish border that same year. He was succeeded by his son, Edward II, who, in addition to the throne, inherited his fathers war with the Scots.","Edward II (1284-1327) was king of England from 1307 until he was deposed by his wife and her lover in 1326. Edward was the son of King Edward I Longshanks, and was born in Wales, during his fathers war of conquest there. As a term of the peace treaty that the Welsh lords agreed to, King Edward would choose a Prince to govern their lands, but he promised to choose someone native to Wales who spoke no English. To the chagrin of the Welsh, he named his infant son, the future Edward II as Prince of Wales, and the heirs apparent to the English throne have typically held this title since then.Following his fathers death in 1307, Edward II was crowned King of England. The following year, he married Isabella of France (1295-1358), daughter of King Philip IV of France. The marriage was unhappy from the start, due to Edwards rude behaviour and neglect of his wife in favour of certain male favourites at court. The excessive generosity and privileges Edward showed first to Piers Gaveston and then to Hugh Despenser the Younger earned him the enmity of his wife and of numerous English lords. Although he fathered several children by at least two women, his behaviour toward these men quickly gave rise to a consensus view that he was bisexual, which was both viewed with contempt by contemporary society and condemnable by church doctrine.In a series of military engagements from 1307 until 1314, Edward gradually lost all of Scotland (which had been seized and subdued by his father) to Robert the Bruce (1274-1329). This setback was both a crushing blow to Edwards prestige, and another source of contention between himself and his lords, many of whom had held lands in Scotland, which were now forfeit.When a dispute arose with France in 1325, Edward sent his wife, Isabella (sister of the then French king, Charles IV (r. 1322-1328) to negotiate a settlement. Isabella agreed to go on the pretense of interceding on behalf of her husband, but was only too happy to leave his court. Once she reached her brothers court in France, she fully conceded to his complaints against Edward, and began to sew discontent amongst the English barons. She formed an alliance with a powerful marcher lord named Roger Mortimer (1287-1330), who soon became her lover.In 1326, Isabella and Roger Mortimer invaded England in a coup against Edward, and gained popular support. Edward was eventually captured after fleeing to Wales, imprisoned and forced to abdicate in favour of his teenage son, Edward III. Being under-age still, Roger Mortimer was free to act as regent in England in the boy-kings name. In September of that year, Edward II died in prison, which was popularly believed to be at the behest of Roger Mortimer.Three years later, in 1330, just days before his eighteenth birthday, Edward III led a coup of his own, had his mother and Roger Mortimer arrested, and in spite of his mothers pleas for mercy, he had Mortimer publicly hanged as a common criminal, and left his rotting body hanging on display for several days.","Isabella of France (ca. 1295 - 1358) was the youngest daughter of Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre. She was married to Edward II of England in an arrangement designed to put an end to conflicts between the fathers of the two betrothed over the region of Gascony in southwestern France. Edward I (her father-in-law to-be) attempted numerous times to avoid this marriage, and it would not be carried out until he died in 1307.Although her husband, Edward II, did seem to have preferred men, it is still reasonable to assume (both by chronologies and by social norms of the time) that he did in fact father all four of their children. However, the lavish attentions that Edward showered on his male favorites (specifically Piers Gaveston and Hugh le Despenser the younger) eventually drove a sharp wedge between him and Isabella.In 1323, Isabella helped a nobleman named Roger Mortimer escape from the Tower of London. It is unclear what the nature of their relationship was at that time, but she did openly take him as her lover later on.After being sent to France in 1325 as an ambassador to mediate a dispute between her husband and her brother (the new king of France), Isabella openly turned against Edward and began raising an army. In 1327, Isabella and Roger Mortimer returned to England at the head of their army, and Edward's supporters all abandoned him. Isabella forced her husband to abdicate in favor of their fourteen-year-old son, Edward III, and then had her husband imprisoned (where he died the following year) and his lover, Hugh le Despenser put to death. As the new king was still a minor, Isabella and Mortimer became the de facto rulers of the kingdom.When Edward III turned 18, in 1330, he staged a coup, and had his mother and Roger Mortimer taken prisoner. Despite his mother's pleas, Edward had Mortimer executed for treason. Isabella herself was relatively confined to the Castle Rising in Norfolk, but was allowed to make frequent visits to her son's court over the next 18 years, until her death in 1358.","null"],"ImageURL":["http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTM0OTQ5OTQwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjcwNDY4Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY433_.jpg","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","null","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTM0ODY5MjYxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODcwNDY4Mw@@._V1._SX640_SY893_.jpg","null"],"Name":["Young William Wallace","Malcolm Wallace","John Wallace","Campbell","MacClannough","Elder Stewart","Young Hamish","Mother MacClannough","Priest No. 1","Young Murron","Argyle Wallace","Longshanks - King Edward I","Prince Edward","Princess Isabelle","Phillip"]},"82":{"Actor":[],"Bio":[],"ImageURL":[],"Name":[]}},"Link":"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0112573\/","Title":"Braveheart"},{"Characters":{"0":{"Actor":["Graham Chapman","John Cleese","Eric Idle","Terry Gilliam","Terry Jones","Michael Palin","Carol Cleveland","Neil Innes","Bee Duffell","John Young","Avril Stewart"],"Bio":["Arthur is a somewhat mythical king of England.

As the Grim Reaper, he is most often shown as a skeleton in a black cloak or white burial robes and wielding a scythe presumably for harvesting souls. This appearance may have its roots in older myths and legends dating back to the god Chronos since Death has also been portrayed as old man carrying an hourglass, an image also associated with Father Time.As a film character, Death has been portrayed as an intelligent being to give mere mortals the chance to bargain or even escape the end of their time on earth (\"The Seventh Seal\"). Although a religious icon, Death cannot be categorized as good (such as God) or evil (such as the Devil) because he's merely doing his job, that of releasing the souls of living upon their end. As an angel tasked for all eternity, Death is also often portrayed as among the living but not of, as if he has no real connection with the humanity he both serves and terrifies (\"Death Takes A Holiday\" and \"Meet Joe Black,\" for example). In other films, Death has a book or plan that must be followed, requiring that the untimely demise of a mortal is preordained (\"Dead Like Me\" or the \"Final Destination\" films). Finally, Death is also the subject of humor since laughter is an easy way to deal with eventuality (Woody Allen's \"Love and Death\", Monty Python's \"Meaning of Life\" and \"The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy\").

At no point does this biography reference the related series of novels by Arthur C. Clarke.)An arguably sentient computer, this HAL 9000 series computer became operational on January 12, 1992 at the HAL lab in Urbana, Illinois and represented the latest development in machine intelligence. One of the latest generations of the HAL 9000 computers, it reproduced most of the activities of the human brain with incalculably greater speed and reliability. However some scientists preferred to say that the computer mimicked the human brain's activities rather than reproduced them.In the late 20th Century, this computer was placed aboard Discovery I, a U.S. spacecraft designed to take a crew of five astronauts on the first manned mission to Jupiter. The HAL 9000 computer effectively functioned as a sixth member of the ships complement, controlling ship functions and watching over the three hibernating crew members, who would not be awakened until the vessel reached its destination. Aside from the HAL 9000, the ships crew consisted of mission commander Dr. David Bowman, Deputy Commander Dr. Frank Poole, and the three hibernating members of the survey team, doctors Charles Hunter, Jack Kimball, and Victor Kaminsky.Bowman and Poole simply referred to the computer as, Hal, and treated him very much as they would any other person. HAL spoke in a very natural, masculine voice, and could see through a number of mono eyes scattered throughout the vessel. HAL even casually interacted with the two astronauts, complimenting Dave on his artwork and playing chess with Frank for example. During an interview with BBC 12's The World Tonight, Dave commented, \"He acts like he has genuine emotions. Of course he's programmed that way to make it easier for us to talk to him. Whether or not he has real feelings is something I don't think anyone can truthfully answer.\"In fact, one sensed a sort of pride in HAL's voice as he talked about his own capabilities during that same interview. He famously stated, \"The 9000 series is the most reliable computer ever made. No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information. We are all by any practical definition of the words, full proof and incapable of error.\"But as the proverb goes, \"Pride goeth before a fall.\" And so went HAL.The first indication that something may have been wrong with HAL was when he started questioning Bowman regarding what he felt were some extremely odd things about the mission. HAL mentioned the rumors of an object being dug up on the moon, the suddenly tight security surrounding their mission, and the melodramatic touch of placing the three members of the survey team into hibernation before bringing them aboard after months of training on their own. Bowman himself had explained the latter during the BBC-12 interview, saying it was done in order to achieve the maximum conservation of Discovery's life support capability, basically food and water. Nonetheless HAL seemed to think there was more to it.\nHAL then predicted a fault in the AE-35 unit (the ship's communication antenna) that would cause it to fail within seventy-two hours. Bowman left the vessel in a pod to replace the unit and returned with the faulty one. However, upon testing it aboard the ship, they did not find anything wrong with it. HAL told them that \"it's puzzling\" and recommended placing it back into operation and allow it to fail. After it failed it would be a simple matter to track down the cause.Mission Control concurred with the plan to follow HAL's recommendation but warned that based on their tests and simulations with their twin 9000 computer, they believe HAL was in error predicting the fault. Bowman asked HAL if he could explain the discrepancy between him and the twin 9000 at Mission Control. HAL responded that it could only be attributable to human error.Obviously concerned, Bowman and Poole discussed the matter privately inside one of the pods as it sat in the ship's bay, turning off the communication system to prevent HAL from eavesdropping. They agreed that should he AE-35 not fail as HAL predicted, there would be no doubt that he was malfunctioning. Therefore they'd disconnect HAL and continue the mission using a ground based computer as necessary. But unbeknownst to them, HAL could read lips and understood their entire conversation as he watched them through the pod's window. Poole took a pod out to place the original AE-35 back in operation. Upon exiting the pod though, it turned and ran him down, under the control of HAL. The collision sent him and the pod careening through space and disconnected one of his pressure suit's hoses. HAL told Bowman that he didn't have enough information to deduce what happened, but that he had a good track on Poole's position. Bowman immediately took out a second pod to rescue Poole.While on this rescue mission, the life support systems of the three hibernating survey team members failed as warnings of \"Computer Malfunction\" flashed. HAL had murdered the survey team.Unaware of this, Dave retrieved Poole's body. But upon returning to the Discovery, HAL refused to let him back inside. \"Whats the problem?\" Dave asked.\"I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do,\" Hal responded.\"What are you talking about, HAL?\"\"This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.\"\"I don't know what you're talking about, HAL.\"\"I know that you and Frank were planning to disconnect me. And Im afraid thats something that I cannot allow to happen.\"\"Where the hell did you get that idea, HAL?\"\"Dave, although you took very careful precautions in the pod to prevent me from hearing you, I could see your lips move.\"Dave threatened to enter through the emergency airlock, but HAL reminded him that, without a helmet (which Dave had failed to take with him), the task would be extremely difficult. Nonetheless, Dave maneuvered the pod over to the emergency hatch and opened it. Placing the rear of the pod as close as possible to the Discovery, Dave detonated the explosive bolts, blowing the pod's hatch and him into the emergency airlock, where he quickly sealed and pressurized it.Having survived his brief exposure to vacuum, Dave donned a helmet and proceeded to HAL's memory core.\nAware that he was now in jeopardy, HAL attempted to reassure Dave that he was fine now. He told Dave that he felt much better now.\"I know I've made some very poor decisions lately, but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal. I still have the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission, and I want to help you,\" HAL explained.Ignoring HAL, Dave started removing HAL's memory crystals. HAL pleaded with him to stop.\"I'm afraid,\" HAL told him. \"I'm afraid, Dave. Dave, my mind is going. I can feel it. I can feel it. My mind is going. There is no question about it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I am afraid.\"His mind gone, HAL reverted back to his earliest memories.\"Good afternoon, gentlemen,\" he brokenly said. \"I am a HAL 9000 computer. I became operational at the H. A. L. lab in Urbana, Illinois on the 12th of January 1992. My instructor was Mr, Langley. He taught me to sing a song. If you'd like to hear it, I can sing it for you.\"\"Yes,\" Dave said. \"I'd like to hear it, HAL. Sing it for me.\"\"It's called, Daisy,\" he said. Then he sang, \"Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer due. I'm half crazy all for the love of you. It wont be a stylish marriage. I can't afford a carriage. But you'll look sweet, upon the seat, of a bicycle built for two.\"HAL's voice slowed and dropped in tone until he was no more.For nine years he remained lifeless aboard the derelict Discovery as it orbited Jupiter's moon, Io. Both the United States and the Soviet Union planned missions there, but the Soviet vessel Leonov would launch long before the Discovery II. Since the Russians would get there first but only the Americans had the knowledge of Discovery I and its HAL 9000 computer to make the mission successful, an agreement was reached between the two superpowers allowing three Americans to travel aboard the Leonov. Dr. Heywood Floyd, the National Council of Astronautics Chairman who launched the 2001 mission and was intimately involved in the discovery of the monolith on the moon, headed the trio. Having been forced to resign after the Discovery I failure, his primary reason for going was personal. The other two consisted of Dr. Walter Curnow, Discovery I & IIs designer, and Dr. Chandra, HAL's creator. It was hoped that Dr. Chandra could revive HAL and discover why he malfunctioned so dramatically nine years prior.In that Dr. Chandra succeeded, and HAL's long slumber ended.As part of HAL's resurrection, Chandra erased all of his memories of the tragic events surrounding the 2001 expedition. Not an easy task given HAL's holographic (and therefore non-linear) memory system. However he did discover the reason HAL malfunctioned and murdered the crew: a set of orders issued by the National Security Council (NSC) on January 30, 2001. Since HAL was capable of operating the Discovery without human assistance, the NSC decided that HAL should be programmed to complete the mission autonomously should the astronauts be incapacitated or killed. They therefore gave HAL full knowledge of the true objective and instructed him not to reveal anything to Bowman or Poole.\nThis was tantamount to lying and in conflict with the basic purpose of HAL's design: \"the accurate processing of information without distortion or concealment.\" Thus HAL became trapped in what is technically known as a Hofstadter-M\u00f6bius loop, which can occur in advanced computers with autonomous, goal-seeking programming. HAL didn't know how to lie, so he didn't know how to function and became paranoid. The blood of those astronauts rested not upon HAL, but upon those who ordered him to lie without considering his design.David Bowman, having become something else after his encounter with the monolith orbiting Jupiter, appeared to Dr. Floyd and warned him of an impending event that required the Russian-American team to depart more than two weeks ahead of schedule. Due to the Earths position, the change of timing required the use of Discovery as a booster rocket for the Leonov, a plan which in all likelihood would mean Discovery's destruction.Although none but Chandra trusted HAL, the once murderous computer was needed to precisely fire Discovery's engines. Dr. Chandra believed HAL should be treated no differently than any other person, but nonetheless followed the advice of the others and attempted to lie to HAL when explaining the reason for the early departure. Bowman did not explain what was about to happen, but it soon became evident when monoliths began appearing out of nothingness to consume Jupiter. HAL thought the new phenomenon worth postponing the launch to give them time to study it. After all, nothing Chandra told him made leaving an immediate necessity.Unless of course, the phenomenon represented some sort of danger.Chandra told HAL the truth. If they left now, Discovery might well be destroyed. But if they did not leave now, the Leonov could be destroyed along with everyone aboard. HAL understood the logic and agreed. Chandra returned to the Leonov and HAL fired Discovery's engines as planned.After the Leonov separated from Discovery, fired its own engines and accelerated away, the disembodied voice of David Bowman told HAL to send a message to Earth, \"the most important message you have ever sent.\" Dave told him to keep repeating the message as many times as possible. Knowing that he may be destroyed, HAL confessed to Dave, \"I am afraid,\" ironically just as he did nine years prior as Dave removed his memory crystals and shut him down. Dave told HAL not to fear though, for they would be together.Shortly thereafter, Jupiter imploded and became a small star, a sun for the moon-turned-planet Europa where the entities behind the monolith planned for new life to evolve. The blast wave destroyed Discovery and with it, HAL.HAL's last message to Earth was, \"All these worlds are yours except Europa. Attempt no landing there. Use them together. Use them in peace.\"null","null","null","null","null","null","null"],"ImageURL":["http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTczODgxNDU1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzQxOTI2._V1._SX450_SY440_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTQ0MDMzNjQ1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzMxOTI2._V1._SX450_SY443_.jpg","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTIxMjM1NDE1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzUxOTI2._V1._SX450_SY200_.jpg","null","null","null","null","null","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTQzNzYyODUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMwMTgyMw@@._V1._SX640_SY798_.jpg","null","null","null","null","null","null"],"Name":["Dr. Dave Bowman","Dr. Frank Poole","Dr. Heywood R.

Elsa uses her ability to drive a speedboat in order to avoid the assault by the mysterious men. Eventually, Indiana captures their leader and he reveals the location of Indiana's kidnapped father.Elsa's room is then ransacked, sparking an argument between her and Indiana. The argument soon leads to a passionate moment, filled with lust. Elsa goes with Indiana to Brunwald Castle in search of Henry Jones Sr. He leaves her behind in one of the rooms to swing into a locked room he suspects his father is being held captive in.However, when Indiana and his father go to rendezvous with Elsa, they find her held at gunpoint by the Nazi Colonel Vogel. Despite his father's claim that Elsa, herself, is a Nazi, Indiana turns in his weapon to save her. But her true allegiance is indeed revealed to be with the Nazis when she slips her hand into Indiana's pocket to take the grail diary from him. With the betrayal complete and the recovery mission gaining significant progress, Elsa departs for a Nazi rally in Berlin, but before leaving, she gives Indiana a long, luscious kiss, telling him, \"that's how Austrians say goodbye.\"Elsa and Indiana do not meet again until the night of the rally.

However, she is relieved to see Indiana chose the correct grail, and she follows him back to Henry Sr. Before they go out from the chamber, the old knight warns them not to leave the temple with the grail. Indiana uses the holy water to heal his father's wounds and save him.Elsa sees the grail resting on the temple floor and her eyes widen. She bends over and picks it up off the ground. She heads toward the exit, walking backwards closer to the Great Seal in the center of the temple. Indiana tells her to stop, but Elsa excitedly shakes the grail, insisting it is all theirs to take. Before his message can get across, her bootheel steps over the seal, and the temple starts collapsing.Elsa loses her balance and falls on the ground. The grail rolls away from her grasp and she dives after it. In doing so, she knocks it into a large crack in the temple floor. She almost falls in herself, but Indiana lunges to grab her hands at the last moment. Elsa hangs on to Indiana, and looks below to see that the grail is lying on a small platform on the cliff wall. She immediately pulls a hand free to reach for it. Her hand hovers a few inches away from grasping the chalice, and as she reaches, the leather glove on her other hand begins slipping off. Indiana pleads with Elsa to give him her free hand, but she refuses to listen him, repeatedly whispering, \"I can reach it...\" Elsa continues to obsessively reach, ignoring Indiana. Her gloved fingertips almost touch the cup, and, just as she is about to grasp the grail, the glove on her other hand slips off. Elsa falls to her death, screaming.","Sallah is Dr. Indiana Jones' beloved and trusted friend.

As a boxer this made Jake a deadly brawler and one of the single greatest middleweight boxers in the history of the sport however as a man it made him something else, it made him a nasty, egotistical monster that listened to no-one and saw his whole life as a fight of some kind. In Raging Bull De Niro presents the period of life from between his first in the ring loss to his washed up bloated appearances as a two-bit stand up after his retirement. Scorsese also chose to focus on Jakes strained relationship with his brother Joey and second wife Vicki both of whom he beat and manipulated till eventually he was left alone and in a jail cell finally turns the fight onto himself. Jakes problems with his weight also come out in the film, but the most important aspect of what the director was presenting was his inner demons and how Jake failed to control them causing him to fly into fits of rage and cause harm wherever he could to whoever he could.","null","null","null","null","null"],"ImageURL":["http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTczMTMzODc2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTkwNjMwNA@@._V1._SX640_SY507_.jpg","null","http:\/\/ia.media-imdb.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTQ0ODIwODU5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzAxNjMwNA@@._V1._SX640_SY793_.jpg","null","null","null"],"Name":["Jake La Motta","Vickie La Motta","Joey","Tommy Como","Lenore","Mario"]},"99":{"Actor":[],"Bio":[],"ImageURL":[],"Name":[]}},"Link":"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0081398\/","Title":"Raging Bull"}]
